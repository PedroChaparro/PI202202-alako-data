Lo básico siempre será: 1. Higiene, buena limpieza de la piel. 2. Hidratación de la piel. 3. Cuidarnos del sol (medidas de fotoprotección física, como el uso de sombrero, sombrilla, gorra, gafas de sol, ropa protectora, buscar la sombra, etc) y el uso de protector solar.

This is the official title of my position. I am not, however, a licensed dermatologist or esthetician, nor do I claim to know more than either. I have checked with multiple dermatologists and estheticians to ensure that my use of the word 'specialist' is appropriate, to which they have confirmed so long as I disclose that I am not a dermatologist or esthetician. After consulting my subscribers as well, I felt that because the term specialist is my career title and is deemed appropriate by licensed professionals, I would prefer to use it instead of the terms 'expert' or 'guru', neither of which apply to me because I consider myself far below 'expert status'. Please know that I'm doing my best to use your feedback to describe who I am and what I do in the best way! If you have concerns about your skin, I always recommend going to either a dermatologist or esthetician to resolve your concern.* ✨ PRODUCTS ON MY SHELF ✨ 💚YTTP Kale + Green Tea Cleanser ($36): http://bit.ly/2pbvxoR 🌿 iUnik Centella Gel Cream ($10): http://shrsl.com/229st ⚪ The Ordinary Niacinamide Serum ($7): http://bit.ly/37AjYJI 🌊 Simple Micellar Gel Wash ($7): https://amzn.to/35Vw0LN 🐟 Krave Beauty Great Barrier Relief ($28): https://bit.ly/2TmCYqi ___________________________________________________________________ FOLLOW ME Instagram (@SkinCarebyHyram): https://bit.ly/362vLzH Twitter (@SkinCarebyHyram): https://bit.ly/2JfRM4n BUSINESS/PR INQUIRIES: info@skincarebyhyram.com *Some links may be affiliate links that help me earn a small commission from your purchase.

Skin care is of the utmost importance, as your skin is the first thing people see when they look at you. By combining this skin care routine with a healthy lifestyle, ANYONE can get clear skin. Things I didn't mention: -I use raw, organic honey as a face mask once every week. I typically do this in the morning, but it can also be done at night. I wash my face, rinse with warm water, pat dry, and then I lather the honey across my entire face. I then let the honey sit for approximately one hour before rinsing with cold water, pat drying again, and applying my moisturizers (as shown in the video). -I drink one gallon of water every day. -I work out regularly. -I'm a vegan, and I eat VERY clean. -My skin genetics are about average.

This short and well balanced sequence provides you with everything you need to get your daily dose of flexibility, mobility \\u0026 relaxation. Feel free to implement this routine in your daily workout schedule to get the best results. Physically and mentally. I´m also really happy that you enjoy my playlist for this routine. These are the songs I used: Michael FK - Change L.M. Styles - Wait on you Faith Richards - My Caffeine Sarah Angel - Lakeview Muted - Belonging (it’s the piano piece) ___ Willkommen zur 15 Minuten Full Body Stretch Einheit! Zu einem ausgewognen Training, gehört auch ausreichend Erholung und Recovery! Daher steht an Tag 7 unserer Fitness-Journey eine wohltuende und ausgleichende Stretching-Routine auf dem Plan. Für mehr Flexibilität, Erholung \\u0026 Entspannung. Ja, auch dieses Video kommt ohne Voice-Over ;) Bewusst! Denn entgegen einer geführten Stretching- oder Yoga-Einheit ist man hier wirklich mal ganz bei sich! Nur du, die Musik, dein Atem und ein kleiner Beep hier und da ;) Vielleicht öffnest du dich also heute mal ganz unvoreingenommen für genau diesen Weg. Auch wenn es nur ein einziges Mal ist. Es wird anders anders sein - davon bin ich überzeugt. Denn wenn es im Aussen still ist, wird es Innen oftmals ganz schön laut. Ich möchte dich ermutigen, dich einzulassen… Die Positionen zu genießen und zu erforschen… Gedanken, die währenddessen aufkommen, einfach zu beobachten…Gut sein zu lassen…Anzunehmen… Loszulassen… Zu sein! Darüberhinaus ist diese Art des Praktizierens ein gute Möglichkeit für einen Übergang zu einer Yoga Self Practise - also das eigenständige Praktizieren.Die Asanas und die Zeit sind vorgegeben, aber die Instruktionen sind dieses Mal dir selbst überlassen.Falls du also schon ein Weilchen mit mir Yoga praktizierst, nutze die heutige „no-talking-session“ doch gerne für eine kleine Bestandsaufnahme in Sachen Ausrichtung und Mindset. Was machen die Schultern in der Vorbeuge, wo sind die Hände im Vierfüßler ausgerichtet und wie hieß nochmal der herabschauenden Hund auf Sanskrit… ;) Das ist nur eine kleiner Impuls meinerseits, denn in meinen Augen bieten uns unterschiedliche Situation nunmal unterschiedlichste Möglichkeiten. Wir müssen nur genau hinschauen und sie wahrnehmen… und annehmen! Wenn du nicht dennoch sträubst, auch in Ordnung ❤️. Dann mache stattdessen gerne diese geführte Full Body Stretch Einheit (15 Minuten): https://youtu.be/qFgwrTc1e1I Wenn du mehr willst, mache 30 Minuten Full Body Stretch: https://youtu.be/FUHzkAbrOlg Und wenn du dich fragst, was erzählt sie da eigentlich, ich will mich doch einfach nur Dehnen 😂😂😂 Perfekt! Dann bist du genau richtig hier ❤️ Schön, dass du da bist. Alles Liebe. Mady 🤘🏼🐾 ******************************** NO ADS!

Since the pelvic floor muscles are small, it doesn’t take a lot of movement to work them, so it's best to start with a little and slowly work up. Watch more pelvic exercises here: https://youtu.be/iZdJZjScmCc The pelvic floor is a group of small muscles along the floor of the pelvis. They help support organs in the pelvis and help with stability in the hip area. The first exercise is going to be a pelvic tilt. When done correctly, you are not using your legs to tilt at the pelvis, just your pelvic muscles. Then you can progress to doing pelvic clocks. It’s just like it sounds by imagining you have a clock on your tummy. Then you can tilt at different angles of the clock.\\r\\r The next exercise is a progressive movement, so you can start with each movement at a time. Place a ball in between your knees. Go into a pelvic tilt and squeeze the ball. If those are easy, then lift your feet to where your hips and knees are at about a 90-degree angle. Then if that’s easy, you can place your hands on the front of your thighs to also activate your hip flexors by pushing into your hands. Try to keep your tilt the whole time.\\r The last two exercises focus on the obturator internus muscle. It also attaches to the femur bone to help with stability. So it’s a great general hip exercise as well. Place the ball in between your knees again, and while you squeeze into the ball, push your feet outward without moving them with an isometric squeeze.\\r\\r Finally, wrap a belt or strap around your ankles, and roll onto your stomach. Bend your knees so your feet are up toward the ceiling. Push out into the belt like you are pushing your feet away from each other, and at the same time tighten your core by tucking your tailbone in.

They can help prevent injury, increase core stability, and improve balance. I start with some beginner core exercises \\u0026 then progresses to harder ones. More core exercises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsWYPWmzt5s\\u0026t=0s\\u0026list=PLPS8D21t0eO-RMUZw1CSzzYRotJNy2MaM\\u0026index=3 Progress through these core strength exercises at your own pace. If this is your first time doing core exercises, you may not be ready for the last ones yet. It's better to do the easy ones first and then see how you feel the next day. The first exercise is a pelvic tilt. This is great to get the core moving, and strengthening the whole pelvic area. The second core exercise is going into a bridge. This not only works your core, but it also works your glutes and hamstrings. If two legs are easy, you can do them with one leg at a time. The third exercise is with a Swiss or therapy ball. A prayer plank on the ball is a great way to activate your core. You can do this modified or a full plank. Next you will do a trunk rotation lying down with your feet on the ball. This is great for your oblique muscles. You can also do the trunk rotation seated on the ball. Using a weight will give you an extra workout, but you don’t have to use one. Now for some harder ones for core strengthening. This one is in tall kneeling, and you will lean back slightly. You can have someone hold onto your feet, or you can place them under something for support. When you are ready, you can do them without any support. This works your core, glutes, hamstrings, and quads. Finally you will do a standing march with elbow tap. You can do this on the same side or opposite sides. Try not do bend your back forward, and use your core to lift your knees.

Strength training is an essential component for success with running, however, it is a common lacking component in most runner’s training programs. Due to the fact that the most common running injuries can be associated with lower extremity strength deficits, it is extremely important to educate runners why and how they should perform strength training. In this video, you’ll learn our top 5 favorite strength training exercises for runners, why they’re important, and slight modifications and variations so that you can find the best fit for you and your workout routine! Why is strength training important for runners? Running is an impact sport! Running can impose up to 8x your body weight in force on specific structures in the body. Because of this, running injuries are not uncommon, actually up to 50% of runners at some point in their life will experience an injury because of running. From research and our experience, we believe 80-90% of these injuries are due to training errors, with one of those errors being a lack of quality strength training! What should the exercises focus on? There are 3 components to running that should be addressed with strength training. Propulsion - meaning propelling the body forward with each step you take, this requires strength. Braking - being able to slow yourself down and control your body with each step you take while running, this also requires strength. Single leg - running is a single leg sport, thus you better include single leg strengthening exercises! Below you’ll find an outline of the exercises discussed in the video, be sure to watch the entire video to learn WHY these are important, how to perform them, and modifications/variations you can try out to see what best fits your workout routine! 1.

Breathing Exercises * Sit upright in bed or on the side of your bed * Place your hands around the lower part of your rib cage * Breathe slowly and deeply in through your nose and then let the air slowly leave your lungs.

Neck and Shoulder Stretches Shoulder rolls, stretch forwards and out behind to relieve tight neck, shoulder and upper back muscles 3. Seated Marching Can be performed sitting over the side of the bed or in a chair 4.

Marching on the Spot Promotes circulation to prevent blood clots and helps maintain general fitness 6. Lumbar Rotations Eases low back pain and stiffness caused by bed rest 7. Bridging Exercise Strengthens buttocks, improves circulation and prevents blood clots in calves. Perform this exercise lying on a firm surface in bed or on the ground. 8. Calf Pump Exercises Improves circulation (blood flow) to the lower legs to prevent blood clots. Try to do these exercises hourly when resting lying down or sitting out of bed. Comfortable Elevated Bed Rest Position at Home When at home, resting with the upper body raised promotes deeper breathing, better circulation and can help clear the chest.

Following along with this 10-minute, real-time routine should help keep your muscles and joints moving throughout the day. See Doctor Jo’s blog post about this at: http://www.askdoctorjo.com/desk-exercises-stretches-real-time To start off, work your whole body and large muscles by doing a simple sit to stand movement. Put your feet about shoulder width apart, and stand up and sit down five times. Now while sitting, do a rotation stretch of the upper body to loosen up your spine. Turn one direction in your chair, and grab the back if you want a little more of a stretch. Hold these for about five seconds on each side. Do three on each side. Next, you will stretch your forearm muscles. If you are typing a lot through out the day, these will hopefully feel really good. Start off with your arm straight out in front of you. Bring your wrists downward or into flexion. If you need more of a stretch, push down with the other hand. Hold for about five seconds and alternate sides. Now bring your wrists upward to stretch the opposite side. The next exercises will be seated hip flexion. If you can roll your chair out from under your desk so you don’t hit your knees on the desk. Bring your knee upwards, and slowly come back down. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. Then you will kick your leg out to work your quad muscles. Kick your leg out until your knee is straight, and then pull your toes up towards you for a stretch. You can alternate or do one side at a time. Do ten of these. Now you will stretch your buttocks muscles that you are sitting on all day long. Take the leg of the side you want to stretch, and cross it over the other leg just above the knee. This will look like a figure 4 if you are looking down at your legs. You might feel the stretch already, but if you don’t, keeping your back straight, bend forward at your hips. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, and repeat 3 times. Finally, stretch and exercise your calf muscles to help prevent DVTs. With your feet on the ground, alternate lifting your toes, and then lift your heels. Do ten of these.

Today is a video of the upper body pulling exercise that I usually perform. These are exercises and routines that everyone is familiar with, and we prepared this because there are people who want content related to weight training. Recently, as I continued to work in the hospital, I had problems with my recovery, so I couldn't exercise and lost weight. ㅠ In the future, I will focus on the trainer job again, I am planning to focus on exercise. After taking some time to recover, I will prepare a video of the process of making a body again and upload it gradually. I'm not doing many sports with 3 back and 2 arms.

Through a pilates routine you will train all muscle groups, arms, legs, buttocks, back, shoulders... For the smaller muscles I will use 3 pound (1kg) dumbbells and for the larger ones I will use 5 pound (2.5kg) dumbbells. The use of dumbbells is optional, you can also do the exercises without them or you can add even more weight. For women I recommend a maximum of 10kg. Choose the weight that you can handle, if you are a beginner, first seek to strengthen your body only with your own weight and progressively add more weight. Include at least 2/3 times a week pilates strengthen routines, they are super important to strengthen the muscles, and also burn more fat and improve your body posture.

We’ll share tips about diet planning, and workouts. In a very short time, this channel will turn into an Online Training Platform. Full Body Workout AT HOME FOR BEGINEERS || How To Build Muscle At Home In today’s video, we’ll go through a science-based full-body home workout routine. When we think of a home workout, we assume that they’re inferior for muscle growth. For many bodyweight workouts at home routines out there, this is true. But, this is simply because they aren’t designed properly. You can make comparable gains in muscle mass by using either lighter loads (like bodyweight exercises) or heavier weights in the gym. But there are a couple key points that people overlook when it comes to home full-body workout routines. First off, is that you need to push to near failure for every single set you perform in this full-body home workout routine. If you stop well short of failure during your sets then you’ll fail to fully activate all the motor units within your muscles. And you won’t experience the same amount of growth that you would when using heavyweights. Secondly, you need to be working with a weight or resistance that is at least 30-40% of your 1 rep max if you want to maximize growth. So 30-40% of your 1 rep max equates to around 30-40 reps per set. So, make sure you can’t do more than that for the following exercises. All that said, we’re now ready to dive into the full home workout. The first exercise we’ll use here is narrow grip push-ups with the hands placed in a diamond shape, which will be used to target the chest and triceps. Next, we’ll use the inverted row to target our overall back with most of the emphasis on the mid-back for thickness. Then, the third exercise is pike push-ups, which mainly target the shoulders and triceps. Now, it’s time to target the back, primarily the lats, with a vertical pulling angle through the sliding lat pulldowns. The fifth bodyweight exercise is the bicep towel curls, which allow for arms isolation. Then, to target the long head of the triceps, you can simply switch over and perform tricep extensions in your setup for the bicep curls. For most of us, bodyweight squats just aren’t going to cut it. This is why we’ll use the towel set up again to perform assisted pistol squats to target the quads and glutes. For the eighth exercise, we’ll move onto the Bulgarian split squat with your rear leg elevated on a platform, which will again further target the quads and glutes. Lastly, we’ll use the sliding leg curl to work the hamstrings through both hip and knee extension. Now, as for your home workout routine, just like your exercises in the gym, it’s vital that you get adequate rest of roughly 2 minutes between each of your sets. And to do so in this workout while saving time, you can perform the following upper body exercises in a superset fashion: Pleased to share with you a few of my favorite exercises that you can perform at home or anywhere you go without any gym equipment at all. Make sure you execute the movement correctly and stick to the whole circuit for the best results. Please comment below if you have any questions at all. Thanks again for the constant support.

But, this is simply because they aren’t designed properly. You can make comparable gains in muscle mass by using either lighter loads (like bodyweight exercises) or heavier weights in the gym. But there are a couple key points that people overlook when it comes to home full-body workout routines. First off, is that you need to push to near failure for every single set you perform in this full-body home workout routine. If you stop well short of failure during your sets then you’ll fail to fully activate all the motor units within your muscles. And you won’t experience the same amount of growth that you would when using heavyweights. Secondly, you need to be working with a weight or resistance that is at least 30-40% of your 1 rep max if you want to maximize growth. So 30-40% of your 1 rep max equates to around 30-40 reps per set. So, make sure you can’t do more than that for the following exercises. All that said, we’re now ready to dive into the full home workout. The first exercise we’ll use here is narrow grip push-ups with the hands placed in a diamond shape, which will be used to target the chest and triceps. Next, we’ll use the inverted row to target our overall back with most of the emphasis on the mid-back for thickness. Then, the third exercise is pike push-ups, which mainly target the shoulders and triceps. Now, it’s time to target the back, primarily the lats, with a vertical pulling angle through the sliding lat pulldowns. The fifth bodyweight exercise is the bicep towel curls, which allow for arms isolation. Then, to target the long head of the triceps, you can simply switch over and perform tricep extensions in your setup for the bicep curls. For most of us, bodyweight squats just aren’t going to cut it. This is why we’ll use the towel set up again to perform assisted pistol squats to target the quads and glutes. For the eighth exercise, we’ll move onto the Bulgarian split squat with your rear leg elevated on a platform, which will again further target the quads and glutes. Lastly, we’ll use the sliding leg curl to work the hamstrings through both hip and knee extension. Now, as for your home workout routine, just like your exercises in the gym, it’s vital that you get adequate rest of roughly 2 minutes between each of your sets. And to do so in this workout while saving time, you can perform the following upper body exercises in a superset fashion: Pleased to share with you a few of my favorite exercises that you can perform at home or anywhere you go without any gym equipment at all.

They are also performed in real time so it's easy to follow along. See some hip stretches: https://youtu.be/TQycKHiJlZg When we sit for a long time, our hips can get weak and fatigued. Instead of doing the exercises for reps, they will be done for time, 2 sets of 30 seconds. For resistance, a resistive band and a ball will be used.\\r\\r Start off with a 45 second warm up of seated hip flexion, leg extensions (LAQs), and hip rolls outs.\\r\\r Seated hip flexion with a band will help strength your hip flexors and your hip abductors together. Then seated resisted hip roll outs work your external hip rotators and abductors. Now switch to a ball, yoga block, or pillow to squeeze into to strengthen your hip adductors or groin muscles.\\r\\r Finally, bring the band down to your feet to get resisted hip internal and external rotation.\\r Related Videos: 10 Best Hip Strengthening Exercises to Relieve Hip Pain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7WBpar9W6w\\u0026list=PLPS8D21t0eO-Ab_0ywWDTQHflRx8eHcCC\\u0026index=5 Hip Arthritis Stretches \\u0026 Exercises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQNk6mpFsww\\u0026list=PLPS8D21t0eO9IAk7n1m87qrL9emA7bpxE\\u0026index=10\\u0026t=0s =========================================== Dr. Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy.

They are also great for keeping your knees nice and fit. Read Doctor Jo's full blog post about this at http://www.askdoctorjo.com/content/knee-arthritis-stretches-exercises The first stretch is for your calf muscles. Start off with your legs out in front of you. Keep the leg you want to stretch out in front of you. Take a stretch strap, dog leash, belt, or towel and wrap it around the ball of your foot. Relax your foot, and pull the strap towards you stretching your calf muscle. You should feel the stretch under your leg. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, and do three of them. The next stretch is for the hamstrings. Keep your leg that you want to stretch out in front of you. Try to keep your back straight and just bend at your hips. Keep your leg straight and pull your toes towards you to get an extra stretch. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, and repeat three times. The last stretch is for your quad muscles. This time you will lie on your stomach to stretch. Wrap the strap or dog leash around your ankle, and then lie on your stomach. Bring the strap up and around your shoulder so you are comfortable. Then pull the strap towards you bringing the lower leg towards your bottom. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds doing three of them. Now we will move on to the exercises. The first exercise is going to be a quad set. Put your leg straight out in front of you again. You can use a towel roll underneath your knee as a target. Activate your quad muscle by squeezing it and pull your toes toward you at the same time. This will push your knee into the ground. Try to hold this for 5-10 seconds and do 10 of them. Next you will do a short arc quad (SAQ). For this, you will use a foam roll or a rolled up beach towel. You want something big so you have a good bend in your knee. Prop your leg over the roll with your knee on the roll. Try to keep your knee on the roll the whole time, and then lift your foot in the air until your leg is straight. If you pull your toes towards you at the end, this will help activate all the muscles in the leg. Try not to go fast because then you are only using momentum. Go slow and controlled with your movements. Start of with 10 of these. If you get to 20-25 and it is easy, then you can add ankle weights. For the next exercise, you will sit in a chair. This one is called a long arc quad (LAQ). This is similar to the SAQ where you want to go slow and controlled, and then bring your leg up straight out in front of you. Slowly come back down. Start of with 10 of these. If you get to 20-25 and it is easy, then you can add ankle weights. Now you are going to stand up for the last exercises. For the hamstring exercise standing up, you want to keep the top part of your leg as straight as possible in line with your body. It might try to come forward if your muscles are tight, but try to keep it down. Slowly bring your foot back behind you, like you are trying to kick your bottom. Make sure you are going slow and controlled with these. Start of with 10 of these. If you get to 20-25 and it is easy, then you can add ankle weights. The last one is for calf strengthening. With your feet about shoulder width apart, and holding onto something for balance if you need to, come up on your toes bringing your heels off the ground, and slowly come back down. If that becomes easy, you can do this one foot at a time. Start off with ten and work your way up to 20-25.

Pelvic Floor Physiotherapist Michelle teaches you the correct Kegels position, exercise technique and how long for results. These Kegel exercises are for men with erectile dysfunction, bladder or bowel control problems or with prostate surgery. Website: https://www.pelvicexercises.com.au 1. Kegels Position The best position to do Kegels is the position where you feel your pelvic floor muscles working, usually lying down or sitting forward away from the chair support.. 2. Correct Exercise Technique Start by locating your pelvic floor muscles at the base of the penis and around the anus. The correct Kegel technique involves contracting the muscles at the base of the penis by contracting as if to shorten the penis and tighten as if stopping the flow of urine. At the same time tighten the muscles around your anus as if stopping gas from passing. Relax your pelvic floor muscles back to resting level and rest briefly for 5-10 seconds before repeating your next exercise. You should feel your penis move inwards slightly towards, your abdomen and your scrotum lift towards your body. Try to breathe normally during Kegel exercises and avoid holding your breath, tightening your buttocks or upper abdominal muscles. 3. How Many Kegels When starting out, do the number of exercises that you can manage using the correct technique. If you can contract your pelvic floor for 2 seconds, take a brief rest between each exercise and repeat 2 second exercises as many times as you can in succession up to 10 exercises. Repeat this routine 3 times daily i.e. 2 seconds, up to 8-10 times, 3 times daily. As your pelvic floor muscles strengthen progress your training with: * Strong pelvic floor contractions * 8-12 Kegel exercises in a row * 10 second holds * Relax your pelvic floor muscles between Kegels * Rest between every exercise for 5-10 seconds or until recovered Repeat this Kegel exercise routine 3 times daily 4. How Long for Results Strengthening pelvic floor muscles can take up to 5-6 months. Some men with erectile dysfunction or bladder control problems may start to notice a difference in the first month after treatment commences. Reference: Stafford, R. E., Ashton‐Miller, J.

Remember to be very careful with neck stretching exercises, and make sure you have a proper diagnosis from your doctor. Rotation, side bending, flexion, and extension stretching will help loosen your neck muscles. Also stretching your levator scapulae and trapezius muscles will help with some tension headaches. For more physical therapy videos or to Ask Doctor Jo a question, visit http://www.AskDoctorJo.com Doctor Jo on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/AskDoctorJo Doctor Jo on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/AskDoctorJo More Details About This Video: If you are having some neck pain, stiffness, or tightness, check out this video for neck stretches. The neck muscles that are affected the most are your trapezius and levator scapulae muscles. People often describe neck pain as a crick in their neck. First start off with some gentle neck stretches by bringing your chin to your chest and then looking up towards the ceiling. This is neck flexion and extension. Next you are going to take your ear to your shoulder on each side. Make sure you are not shrugging your shoulders up. This is side bending. Then you are going to turn your head from side to side like you are looking over your shoulder. This is neck rotation. If that is not painful, then you can add some overpressure with your hands. Now place your hand under your thigh to keep your shoulder down, then side bend your head to the opposite side and gently put pressure with your other hand to get a stretch through your trapezius muscles. Hold these for 30 seconds and perform 3 times on each side. The final stretch is going to be for your levator scapulae muscle. This is the muscle that is used when you shrug your shoulders, and they can get overworked when you are stressed out. Take your arm on the side of the pain and place it above and behind your shoulder. Then take your opposite arm and place on top and slightly behind your head. Look down towards the opposite knee of the pain and apply gentle pressure for a good stretch. DISCLAIMER: Doctor Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy, however, this video is only designed to help you perform the correct technique of exercises that have ALREADY been given to you by your health professional. They are NOT to take the place of going to your own doctor or therapist. There are many manual techniques that a therapist can do that simply can not be done on your own. Your own therapist will also ensure that you are doing correct techniques with your exercises and stretching. If these techniques aren't done right, they won't help, and they could make things worse. So, if you experience any pain while doing these techniques, STOP immediately and see your doctor.","tags":"neck pain, stiff neck, stoved up, neck flexion, neck extension, crick in neck, chiropractor neck pain, neck stretches, neck exercises, neck pain relief, yoga for neck pain, neck, neck traction, stiff neck relief, neck pain treatment, relieve neck pain, relief for neck pain, neck pain stretches, how to relieve neck pain, neck pain stretch, neck pain cure, neck pain remedies, tight neck muscles, headache in neck, tension headache, askdoctorjo, doctorjo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2NOsE-VPpkE/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2daigSBkx68","title":"Best exercises to strengthen your lower back - Best exercises for low back pain","description":"The 5 best exercises you can do at home to strengthen your lower back and glutes and eliminate pain.

In fact, it's estimated that about 80% of us will experience some form of significant lower back pain in our lives. That means if you haven't had it yet, chances are you will at some point in the future. One of the best ways you can avoid lower back pain is to keep the muscles that support and stabilize your spine strong and healthy. Today I wanted to share with you 5 of my favorite exercises that you can do at home with zero equipment required to strengthen and tone your lower back and help decrease and eliminate low back pain. POSTERIOR CHAIN STRENGTHENING One of the most-often overlooked muscle groups when it comes to lower back and core strengthening is the glutes. Your gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus attach to your pelvis and help to form the foundation upon which your lower back is built. If you want to strengthen your back and eliminate pain, it's imperative that we include exercises that strengthen your glutes as well. HOW TO INCREASE LOWER BACK STRENGTH The lumbar spine or lower back is an area not known for much motion. In fact, it is supposed to be a stable area that is less susceptible to injury and able to hold up to the rigors of heavier lifting and training. If your lower back is weak and required to do too much work, it can easily break down. In order to work to its best, the low back has to get assistance from the glutes to help with extension of the posterior chain from the bottom up as well. The muscles of the low back are asked to fire for long periods of time throughout the day. Often, they have become dormant and underactive because of prolonged sitting. In order to keep them strong, it is important to regularly train these muscles and help to improve the endurance of them. The five exercises shown below will keep your back muscles strong without requiring any expensive or elaborate back extension machines or equipment. ====================================================== 7 Days of healthy recipes and home workouts delivered right to your inbox!

If you know your specific back pain diagnosis, can check out the back pain section of my website for more specific exercises and stretches. See Doctor Jo’s blog post about this at: http://www.askdoctorjo.com/how-to-relieve-back-pain The first stretch is called the pelvic tilt. You will roll back onto your back with your knees bent. You want to imagine pushing your belly button into the ground, or push your back flat onto the ground like you are squishing something. You can put your hand under the curve of your back, and try to push your back into your hand. Make sure you are breathing and not holding your breath while doing these exercises. Next you will do a bridge. Push your bottom up off the ground, but try to do this slowly, and do one segment of your back at a time curling upward. Then slowly go down the same way, one segment at a time. Now you will do a single knee to chest stretch, bend one knee and bring your leg up to your chest as far as you comfortably can. Hold this for 30 seconds and do it three times on each side. Next, bring both knees to your chest, and hold it for 30 seconds doing it three times. This is called a double knee to chest stretch. Then try some gentle trunk rotation stretches on your back with your knees bent in hooklying. Gently rotate your bent legs from side to side. You can hold them on each side for 3-5 seconds or you can continuously rotate them back and forth. Again, try to keep your lower back on the ground. You can start off with 10 and work your way up to 20-25. The next stretch is the prayer stretch. Bring your butt back onto your heels, and keep your arms straight out. Relax your head down to the ground. Hold it for 30 seconds, and do it three times. Finally, you will do a combination move where you start in a plank position, and go into an upward dog yoga position. Hold that for 3-5 seconds, and then make a smooth transition into a downward dog position. You can go through this motion 3-5 times.

And that’s understandable. Belly fat is really easy to gain and notoriously hard to lose. It can seem as though no matter what exercises you try to lose belly fat and no matter how well you eat, the belly fat just won’t budge. And unfortunately, with exception to surgery, there is currently no proven method of being able to spot reduce fat from the belly. There is an exercise, however, that is incredibly underutilized yet powerfully effective when it comes to losing even the most stubborn belly fat. Today I’ll share what that is and how you can start using it right away to lose belly fat. Click below for a step by step plan to lose stubborn fat and build muscle: https://builtwithscience.com/your-potential-realized/?utm_source=YouTube\\u0026utm_medium=Video\\u0026utm_campaign=The+%231+Exercise+To+Lose+Belly+Fat+%28FOR+GOOD%21%29\\u0026utm_term=05%2F06%2F2022 Click below to subscribe for more videos: https://www.youtube.com/jeremyethier/?sub_confirmation=1 Why is belly fat is so hard to lose in the first place? Well, it comes down to the fact that certain areas of your body are easier to lose fat than others, and is largely determined by genetics. Now having your genetics stacked against you may seem problematic if you’re looking to develop a slim or lean looking abdomen, but there is a solution. As long as you create a calorie deficit, you will continue to lose fat. Eventually, if maintained long enough, you will lose excess fat from all areas of your body, even if your genetics put your belly fat at the back of the line. While diet should be your main way of creating a calorie deficit, adding additional exercises could help you to lose belly fat by keeping your metabolism high, even as you’re losing weight from dieting. That said, not all exercises are created equal. While things like running, rowing, cycling, or even HIIT workouts tend to burn calories very quickly, the truth is, the overwhelming majority of people can’t actually stick with traditional cardio long enough for fat loss to reach stubborn areas. And it’s not that these methods don’t work if you stick to it, because they do. The problem is simply that they’re brutal. They require a lot of willpower. Now don’t get me wrong, these forms of cardio definitely do have their place and some people have no problem sticking to them. In fact, I still do these intense sessions once or twice a week for conditioning. But I no longer rely on them as my main form of cardio to lose fat and nor should most people. Because if you want to lose your stubborn belly fat, and more importantly keep it off once it’s gone, then you need something you can stick to for life. What’s the solution? The best exercise to lose belly fat is walking. It’s the easiest to maintain, lowest stress, lowest fatigue, and most versatile form of cardio. According to research, intense forms of cardio like HIIT or running, while time efficient, didn’t provide any superior fat loss effect when compared to longer yet less intense forms of cardio such as walking. Which makes sense. It’s simply a numbers game. Your body doesn’t care whether the calories you burned were from some crazy intense fasted cardio session or from plain old walking. What matters most is what you can do consistently over time. And if you crunch the numbers, you’ll actually find that the calories burned from simply walking can very quickly add up to a meaningful amount. So now that I’ve hopefully convinced you of the power of walking, let’s dive into the specifics of how to lose belly fat from walking. The first step is to determine an average of how many steps you’re currently taking. You can use the health app on your iPhone or use Google Fit if you’re on Android. After a week, see what your daily average comes up to. Some of you however might be surprised with how few steps you’re taking, but this is a good thing, as it means you have a big opportunity to bump that up. Set a realistic goal and first aim to do an extra 2,000 steps a day. Given that the average individual takes about 1,200 steps during 10 minutes of walking, all you have to do is throw in two 10 minutes walks into your day to accomplish that. Once you’re consistent with that, try bumping it up by another 2,000 steps, and continue doing this with the goal of consistently getting at least 8,000 steps or even up to 15,000 steps, which seems to be the range that provides the greatest fat loss and health benefits. Trust me, the little things add up. Apply these tips and you’ll be surprised with just how much they increase your step count and even more surprised by how much of a difference it makes towards your fat loss overtime. That said guys, I want to emphasize that walking or any form of cardio is only effective for fat loss if it’s used in combination with a diet. So use your diet as the primary way to create a calorie deficit and supplement it with walking to help speed up the process.","tags":"how to lose belly fat, lose belly fat, belly fat, stubborn belly fat, exercises to lose belly fat, how to get rid of belly fat, how to burn belly fat, how to lose lower belly fat, best exercise to lose belly fat, how to reduce belly fat, burn belly fat, belly fat loss, reduce belly fat, builtwithscience, jeremyethier, lose stubborn fat, how to lose belly fat fast, lose belly fat fast, how to lose stubborn belly fat, belly fat exercises, how to lose stomach fat, body fat","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mEmynZt2SwY/hqdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT4KtJi8dW0","title":"Top 3 Front Side and Rear Delt Workout - Shoulder","description":"Top 3 Front Side and Rear Delt Workout - Shoulder","tags":"Top 3 Front Side and Rear Delt Workout, Shoulder, shoulders, front delt workout, side delt workout, rear delt workout, front delt, side delt, rear delt, shoulder, front delt workout at gym, side delt workout at gym, rear delt workout at gym, rear delt workout gym, gym workout rear delt, rear delt gym workout, shoulder workout, shoulder workout at gym, shoulders workout, best shoulder workout, shoulder workout in gym","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lT4KtJi8dW0/hqdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc62Ju2kUAc","title":"Improve Your Balance with Simple Exercises - Ask Doctor Jo","description":"Improve your balance with these simple and advanced balance exercises to get your ankles stronger and improve your overall balance and gait.

These great balance exercises can help get your ankles and fine motor muscles stronger. Start with progression by holding on with two hands. When that gets easy, go to one hand, then some fingers, and then eventually not hold on at all. The first exercise is putting your feet as close together as you can. This is called the Romberg stance. If that is easy, try closing your eyes. If that is easy, move your head from side to side, and up and down. Then combine them together with head movements and eyes closed. The next balance exercise is called tandem stance. This is with one foot directly in front of the other like you are standing on a tight rope. Follow the same progression as above. Make sure to switch your feet. If all of these become easy, you can try standing on one foot and doing the same progression. For higher level exercises, you can try it with an uneven surface. Try standing on a pillow or a foam cushion and go through all the exercises above.

This can be caused by coughing, laughing, sneezing, or impact exercises.

Basically, this is when there is involuntary bladder leakage due to a combination of increased pressure or tension in the abdominal area and weak core muscles. The main muscles to focus on are the true core muscles which are the respiratory diaphragm, pelvic floor, deep transversus abdominis (TA), and the multifidus muscles in your back. They work together to help stabilize the core, support our organs, and help prevent leakage.\\r\\r Starting off with proper breathing is the most important part. Holding our breaths during activities increase the pressure which can cause the leaking. Diaphragmatic breathing is not only a great strengthening exercise, but it also helps relax the body as well.\\r\\r Progressing from there, continue with the diaphragmatic breathing and now add in TA exercises by contracting those muscles as you continue to breathe. Next, adding a gluteus bridge helps progress the movement. \\r\\r Now change positions to help train the muscles in different ways. Get onto all fours, or quadruped, for some bird dogs or opposite arm and opposite leg lifts.\\r\\r The final ones will be in standing. Start with a single leg stance continuing with the same earlier patterns. Then add in a bound to help progress into impact exercises.

Purchase the Titan Compression knee sleeves here: http://amzn.to/2pojTED (affiliate link) Knee compression sleeves will also give the knees some compression during the exercises to help the healing process. The first exercise to help strengthen the knee is a short arc quad (SAQ), this is a great way to get started without doing to much to the knee. It helps strengthen the quad muscles with extend or straighten the knee. The next knee strengthening exercises are a bridging series including a regular bridge, bridging with a band, and bridging squeezing into a ball. These all are great for the hamstrings, glutes, and surrounding muscles of the knee and hips. Then you will do a long arc quad (LAQ), this is like the SAQ, but it is a longer arch with works the quad muscles in a bigger range of motion. The final two exercises for the knee are a squat and a squat with a band. Squats do a great job of strengthen all of the lower leg muscles including hamstrings, quads, glutes, hip flexors, and others.

As the discs degenerate, signs of osteoarthritis develop. This can cause achiness and soreness as well as decreased motion in the neck. See Doctor Jo’s blog post about this at: http://www.askdoctorjo.com/cervical-spondylosis-stretches-exercises First start off with some gentle neck stretches by turning your head from side to side like you are looking over your shoulder. This is neck rotation. Hold it for about 10-15 seconds, and go back and forth about 5 times. Next you are going to take your ear to your shoulder on each side. Make sure you are not shrugging your shoulders up. This is side bending. Hold it for about 10-15 seconds, and go back and forth about 5 times. Now bring your chin to your chest and then looking up towards the ceiling. This is neck flexion and extension. Hold it for about 10-15 seconds, and go back and forth about 5 times. Then you are going to do isometric exercises in each direction. Basically this is when you activate the muscle, but you are not moving it. You can do this by gently pressing into your hand in each direction. Hold each one of these for 3-5 seconds. Now place your hand under your thigh to keep your shoulder down, then side bend your head to the opposite side and gently put pressure with your other hand to get a stretch through your trapezius muscles. Hold these for 30 seconds and perform 3 times on each side. The final stretch is going to be for your levator scapulae muscle. This is the muscle that is used when you shrug your shoulders, and they can get overworked when you are stressed out. Take your arm on the side of the pain and place it above and behind your shoulder. Then take your opposite arm and place on top and slightly behind your head. Look down towards the opposite knee of the pain and apply gentle pressure for a good stretch. Hold these for 30 seconds and perform 3 times on each side.

These are great for strengthening your pelvic muscles, glutes, and hamstrings. Then there is the 4 way hip lying down. This is hip flexion (straight leg raise), hip abduction, hip adduction, and prone hip extension. These are great for all the muscles around the hip including, gluteus medius and gluteus maximus, IT band, hamstrings, hip flexors, and others. Now for sitting you will do a seated hip flexion and a squat at your chair. These are great because you can do them at work, or if you have been sitting for a long time. The final hip exercise is a lunge. It sounds pretty simple, but if done right, it can be pretty challenging. You don’t have to bring your knee all the way to the floor, and you can use a target if you need one.

As a physical therapist these are common complaints I treat in my clinic - oftentimes these issues correlate directly with a person's posture. Today I'm sharing 5 of my favorite exercises you can do at home to help correct these postural issues. ➡️ Here's an Amazon link to my favorite foam roller: https://amzn.to/2PTB2SD OTHER VIDEOS TO WATCH AFTER THIS ONE: ✅ 10-MINUTE DAILY POSTURE ROUTINE: https://youtu.be/jB1Yb9PMm-U ✅ EXERCISES TO FIX NECK HUMP FAST: https://youtu.be/cPA_hM80s8s ✅ HOW TO STRENGTHEN YOUR UPPER BACK POSTURE: https://youtu.be/N0hpxqIePaQ ✅ HOW TO ELIMINATE MUSCLE KNOTS IN YOUR NECK, SHOULDERS, AND BACK: https://youtu.be/9PC9Mn0VO00 ✅ 6-MINUTE POSTURE FIX ON A FOAM ROLLER: https://youtu.be/042b7nPnNIk As a physical therapist, I treat many posture related problems. The thing is – people don’t come in to my clinic complaining of “bad posture“. People come into my clinic complaining of the symptoms that are typically associated with bad posture. Neck pain, knots in your upper shoulders, headache pain, etc. are typically related to poor posture. These are the complaints for which people typically seek Physical Therapy help; little do these patients know how many of them wouldn’t be in any pain if they just spent some time addressing their posture! Today on Tone and Tighten I wanted to discuss these postural issues – specifically what is poor posture, why you developed it, and some simple exercises you can do to correct this problem. WHAT IS POOR POSTURE? Poor posture is typically characterized by what we refer to as a “forward head and rounded shoulders“ posture. When you stand up straight and tall, if I were to look at your profile from the side your ear should be directly located over the tip of your shoulder. Your sternum/chest should be pointed up with your shoulder blades sent back. This is what “good“ posture looks like. In this position, gravity holds your head squarely on top your neck with very minimal muscle activation required. This results in minimal tension, decreased muscle knots, and decreased muscle activation. WHY DOES POSTURE MATTER? Again, bad posture is typically characterized by a “forward head and rounded shoulders“. Forward head refers to the position of your head relative to your shoulders. It simply means that if I were to look at your standing posture from the profile view your ear would be out in front of the tip of your shoulder. This typically causes a “rounding“ forward of the shoulder blades and an increased visible “hump“ in the upper back. In this position, your head is not in an ideal anatomical location. Gravity would cause it to flop forward if not for some muscle activation to hold it up. So to prevent your head from flopping forward you must activate the muscles in your neck and upper shoulders. 15–30 minutes at a time this might be OK, but when you spend 8 – 12 – 16 hours in this position, those muscles can get extremely fatigued. The result is increased tension in your neck, pain with movement, stiffness, knots in your upper shoulders, and even headaches. HOW TO TREAT POOR POSTURE The muscles in your body are highly adaptable to stresses placed on them or removed from them. Our forward head and rounded shoulders posture typically results in what we refer to as an “upper cross syndrome“. The muscles through the front of your chest and back of your neck get tight while the muscles through your upper back and front of your neck get stretched out and week. The treatment for this poor posture issue is to basically reverse our “upper cross syndrome“. We need to stretch where it’s tight (upper chest, front of the shoulders, and neck) and strengthen where it’s weak (rhomboids and middle traps – between your shoulder blades). Here are 5 of my favorite exercises to help you overcome these problems. Push “Play” on the video above for a detailed description of the principles discussed in this post including an explanation of the following exercises. (1:01) WHAT IS POOR POSTURE? (2:05) SIMPLE POSTURE TEST (4:10) FOAM ROLLER OVERHEAD (6:41) FOAM ROLLER ANGEL (7:26) DOORWAY STRETCH (8:49) WALL ANGELS (10:47) FLOOR ANGELS Remember – oftentimes you don’t feel “poor posture”… but you certainly feel the effects from it. If you carry a large amount of tension in your neck and shoulders, get neck pain regularly, or experience tension headaches – your posture certainly could be playing a role in that. Performing these exercises regularly will help to improve your posture. In fact many of my patients notice a significant improvement in about a month; it might be up to 3 months to see a remarkable improvement (it took your body a long time to develop poor posture; it’s going to take some time and effort to reverse this problem). You have to be diligent and consistent, but I know these can help you out!","tags":"home exercises for posture, best exercises to improve posture, how to correct poor posture, how to fix poor posture, jared beckstrand, how to fix posture, improve posture, how to improve posture, shoulder posture, correct posture, poor posture, how to fix neck posture, desk posture, neck posture, posture, fix hunchback posture at home, forward head posture fix, tone and tighten, best posture, physical therapy, nerd neck, stiff neck exercise, back strength","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5R54QoUbbow/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYMmtEFhuxA","title":"Back Pain Relief Stretches – 5 Minute Real Time Routine","description":"These back pain relief stretches are great for helping to relieve general back pain and back stiffness. The back stretches are done in real time, so they are easy to follow.

Sometimes you might not have enough time to go through your whole routine, which can be time consuming. If you are in a hurry, still hold the back stretches for 30 seconds, but do less reps. \\r\\rStarting off with a warm up will help loosen up the back and hip muscles. Pelvic tilts are a great way to get things moving.\\r\\r Lying down on the bed, floor, or couch, knee to chest and trunk rotation stretches really help loosen up and open up the back area.\\r\\r Next sitting, a quadratus lumborum (QL) stretch will give great relief to the low back.\\r\\r Finally, child’s pose (prayer stretch) and cat/cow (cat/dog) stretches will help the whole body relax.

For this video, I teamed up with Dr. Jen, a pelvic floor physical therapist who also happens to be pregnant! She'll show you her top 5 exercises to help relieve low back pain when you are pregnant by mobilizing and stabilizing the pelvis. Watch more videos at https://www.askdoctorjo.com The first exercise to help relieve low back pain during pregnancy is an anterior and posterior pelvic tilt. This is when you are emphasizing moving your hips forwards and backwards. The next lower back exercise is a lateral pelvic tilt, or moving your pelvis in a side to side direction. Now you will focus on stability with your core muscles including the diaphragm, pelvic floor, transversus abdominis, and multifidus muscles (deep spinal muscles). This should be done while you are breathing normally, so try not to hold your breath. After you achieve this, you can add in a bridge to activate the gluteus muscles. Then you will get onto all fours, or in quadruped. Then you will do pelvic tilts again, or some call it the cat/dog exercise or stretch. You can also do lateral tilts as well. Finally, you will do the child’s pose or prayer stretch.

Once you have checked this video out, you can watch the strengthening video (http://youtu.be/-tHXkt5JZMc) to help keep them strong and prevent further injuries. For more physical therapy videos or to Ask Doctor Jo a question, visit http://www.AskDoctorJo.com Doctor Jo on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/AskDoctorJo Doctor Jo on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/AskDoctorJo More Details About This Video: Shin splints occur very often in runners who are training for long distance running. The tibialas muscles become inflamed and irritated. Most of the time it is your anterior tibialis muscle, the one in the front, but occasionally they can be your posterior tibialis muscle, the one in the back. Make sure to go to a doctor to get evaluated because sometimes you can have a stress fracture instead of shin splints. Start off by sitting in a long sit with your legs straight out in front of you. Point your toes downward as far as you comfortably can. You can add a little pressure to get an extra stretch. For more of a stretch, roll over and flatten your feet in a push up position, and push up on the top of your feet. Then you can try kneeling back onto your feet with your toenails on the floor, and lift up onto your toes as seen in the video. Now you will see some stretches with a noodle or foam roll. Place the roll on the top of your knee, and roll it down your shin or anterior tibialis. Apply more body pressure to get more of a stretch. Then you can turn over and do the same thing with your calf. Roll down your calf muscle, or gastrocnemius muscle, and apply more body pressure for more of a stretch. DISCLAIMER: Doctor Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy, however, this video is only designed to help you perform the correct technique of exercises that have ALREADY been given to you by your health professional. They are NOT to take the place of going to your own doctor or therapist. There are many manual techniques that a therapist can do that simply can not be done on your own. Your own therapist will also ensure that you are doing correct techniques with your exercises and stretching. If these techniques aren't done right, they won't help, and they could make things worse. So, if you experience any pain while doing these techniques, STOP immediately and see your doctor.","tags":"shin splints, calf pain, shin pain, plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, shin stretching, anterior tibialis stretching, calf stretch, poor gait mechanics, running pain, leg pain, front of leg pain, shin splint stretches, shin splint, exercises for shin splints, stretches for shin splints, shin stretches, calf stretches, shin splint exercises, shin splint stretch, how to stretch shin splints, stretching shin splints, shin splints stretches, askdoctorjo, doctorjo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z2G5WCJBpps/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKObkQ5TikQ","title":"Exercises and Stretches for Arthritis","description":"Airrosti’s Dr. Brooke Halboth demonstrates four simple exercises that can help you manage your arthritis pain in your upper and lower body.

Then ball squeezes or hip adduction isometrics and side lying hip adduction exercises will help strengthen the groin or adductors. Next in a seated position on the floor, you can try the butterfly stretch. This way will be a little more intense with the stretch. Now standing up, you can try a sumo stretch. This is harder to do, and you will get an even bigger stretch, so you might want to wait for this one until the others are easy to do. Finally, a side lunge will not only stretch the groin, but it will also strengthen it as well.

This daily stretching routine will help improve mobility in your spine, hips, and shoulders and decrease pain in your neck and back. These are my top stretches that I prescribe in my physical therapy clinic - perform them everyday to improve range of motion, mobility, and function! ➡️ LINK TO STRETCH OUT STRAP: https://amzn.to/2KzOgD6 ⭐️ UPDATED!! EVERYDAY STRETCHES TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY: https://youtu.be/KsYUVCZzheQ ✅ FOLLOW-ALONG STRETCHING ROUTINE FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN’T FLEXIBLE: https://youtu.be/FI51zRzgIe4 ✅ 10 BEST STRETCHES FOR LOWER BACK PAIN: https://youtu.be/0wAw1-1MHa4 ✅ DO THIS EVERY MORNING! 5-MINUTE MOBILITY FOLLOW-ALONG ROUTINE: https://youtu.be/8abmMQe_Fpo Mobility is one of the critical components to our overall wellness. In order to maintain normal, pain-free function and movement, we have to be mindful of our flexibility and mobility - especially in our spines (collectively the most mobile part of our body). Our muscles and joints undergo what we call “adaptive shortening” and “adaptive lengthening” based on the stresses (or lack thereof) placed upon an area. Basically - our bodies and joints operate under a “use it or lose it” principle. If we don’t take our joints into their end ranges of available motion and if we stay fixed in one posture for an extended period of time, we start to lose our range of motion. This can result in feelings of tightness, stiffness, and even pain. The best way to combat these effects is by regularly taking your joints into ranges that they should go into and that they’re capable of going into, but don’t get there regularly. That’s where these exercises come in. This is a collection of the best exercises to stretch key muscles and joints into their end ranges of motion to increase your mobility and promote normal pain-free movement. Click on the time stamps below to be taken directly to each exercise in the video. 1. CHIN TUCKS (3:38) - My go-to exercise to decrease pain, tension, and even headaches in your cervical spine (neck). This is a must if you spend long periods of time in a “forward head posture” (working at a laptop, looking at a tablet or phone, etc). 2. NECK AND UPPER BACK EXTENSION STRETCHES (4:40) - Think about it - we rarely look up! Our whole lives are in front of us and we spend a lot of time looking straight or down. But our necks and our upper backs are designed to extend - to look up and move backwards. One of the best things you can do for your neck and upper back is to improve extension mobility. CORRECT YOUR UPPER BACK AND NECK POSTURE NOW: https://youtu.be/5R54QoUbbow 3. DOORWAY STRETCHES (6:54) - When we slump, our head comes forward on our necks and our shoulders round forward and in. To break out of this posture we need adequate range of motion through the front of the chest and shoulders. This is my go-to stretch to target those area. 4. LOWER BACK EXTENSION STRETCH (8:44) - We spend a lot of time sitting and many of our daily motions involve forward bending. Rarely do we extend our spines back the other direction in an effort to stretch them out. That’s where this stretch comes in. *Don’t do this one if you have certain specific spine conditions. If you’re dealing with back pain from things like stenosis, degenerative disc disease, or spondylolisthesis, please do not perform these extension exercises. You need to promote spine flexion (bending forward) to stretch your back out safely. BEST EXERCISES FOR DISC BULGE AND SCIATICA: https://youtu.be/fDkw-Zi5MBg 5. HIP FLEXOR STRETCH (10:40) - we spend a lot of time sitting. Over time our hip flexors can adapt and shorten in this position. The unfortunate part about this is one of your hip flexor muscles attaches to your lower back vertebrae. If your hip flexors are tight they can pull on these vertebrae and pull your back forward and out of proper alignment. HIP FLEXOR PAIN? YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS ONE: https://youtu.be/zTPfzlZbtz8 6. HAMSTRINGS STRETCH (12:13) - Probably the one area/muscle group that most of us could use a little work on - our hamstrings are an area that are prone to becoming tight. They also have a connection on the pelvis and can contribute to lower back pain if not stretched out properly.

The cartilage gets worn away, causing the rough bone ends to rub against each other. Irregular motion and bone spurs along with inflammation can result in pain and loss of motion in the shoulder. Exercise can be a useful way to help manage arthritis symptoms, but it’s important to be careful with certain activities. Shoulder arthritis can be aggravated by heavy lifting or overhead activities. Regular exercise of the shoulder muscles can help reduce pain, support healthy cartilage, as well as increase range of motion and function.

Buy a worksheet with these shoulder stretches: https://www.askdoctorjo.com/7-shoulder-stretches-worksheet In general when stretching the shoulders, you should hold most stretches for 30 seconds, and do them 3 times. Sometimes you might not have enough time to go through your whole routine, which can be time consuming. If you are in a hurry, still hold the shoulder stretches for 30 seconds, but do less reps. A quick warm up will help warm up and loosen the shoulder muscles to help get them going. A great way to stretch the shoulder is by stretching out the joint capsule. You can stretch the posterior capsule or a cross arm stretch, and you can stretch the inferior capsule with a triceps stretch.\\r\\r Also, stretching some of your rotator cuff muscles, like the subscapularis may help relieve the shoulder pain. If going into external rotation of your shoulder is painful, you can modify this stretch.\\r\\r Finally, a chest or pec stretch and an upper trap stretch will help the shoulder and neck areas.\\r Related Videos: Shoulder Pain Treatment \\u0026 Rehab Stretches: https://youtu.be/DJvQ3ZGWUfQ?list=PLPS8D21t0eO_Ny9ors3aP4K1P_91a2-yw Shoulder Pain Top 3 Exercises: https://youtu.be/vbUm5rsPt5Y?list=PLPS8D21t0eO_Ny9ors3aP4K1P_91a2-yw =========================================== Dr. Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy.

This 7-minute follow-along stretching routine is what I recommend: https://youtu.be/Rjojo8ysStQ =================================== JARED'S RECOMMENDED FOAM ROLLER (aff): https://amzn.to/3Ctlb3M JARED'S EXTRA THICK HOME WORKOUT MAT (aff): https://amzn.to/3Hxstr0 =================================== Increasing the strength and function of the muscles that act on the knee joint is a great way to decrease pain, and improve function. Now when we talk about the mechanics of the knee, it’s a relatively simple joint. It flexes (bends) and extends (straightens) and that’s about it. The muscles that are primarily responsible for these two actions include the quadriceps, hamstrings, and one of your calf muscles. Increasing strength and function in these muscles has been proven to have a positive effect on decreasing knee pain. However, as a doctor of physical therapy and a trained movement specialist, we are taught to find the CAUSE of pain, not just the location. Often times knee pain is simply a manifestation of faulty mechanics either higher or lower in the leg. It’s actually your hip and ankle that primarily determine where your knee joint bends and straightens and therefore play a bigger role in the mechanics at the joint. Improving strength and stability in these areas is vital in knee rehab and decreasing pain in the knee joint. Presented in this video are the best exercises to increase strength of the muscles that flex and extend your knee as well as those that play a key factor in knee joint mechanics and function. (2:42) QUAD SET: a simple, sustained contraction to the quadriceps muscle to increase strength and voluntary firing. (3:43) STRAIGHT LEG RAISE: adding hip flexion to the quad contraction is an effective way to strengthen the knee. (4:55) SHORT ARC QUAD: adding slight flexion and contracting the quad into terminal extension can be an effective means of strengthening as well as getting the knee joint used to moving again. (5:59) BRIDGES: Great way to increase glute and hamstring strength without introducing potentially painful motion at the knee.

Watch another frozen shoulder video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT8gPa-6B-c\\u0026index=5\\u0026list=PLPS8D21t0eO_Ny9ors3aP4K1P_91a2-yw\\u0026t=0s For a frozen shoulder, signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to three years. Stretches and exercises can help speed up the recovery time. First, using a pulley to help get your motion passively, can be very helpful. Since you are able to completely relax for the stretch, you can often get more motion. The next stretches are called pendulums. For a frozen shoulder, using a small weight in your hand helps open up the shoulder joint. You can also rock front to back and side to side. It’s a great way to relax all your shoulder muscles. A scapular or shoulder squeeze will help open up your chest area, and also strengthen your upper back muscles. You can add a resistive band by doing rows. Make sure you add the squeeze at the end. One of the toughest motions is internal rotation behind your back. Using a towel to stretch, will get you much more motion. If you have a Swiss (or stability) ball, using it to roll out your arm will not only stretch out your shoulder, but it can also work the stability of your shoulder. You can also do these slides on a table or counter top. The last stretch is a shoulder flexion stretch using the ground for assistance. Get on the ground and sit on your feet in a child’s pose position. If you can’t get on the ground or your knees hurt too much to bend them, you can slide your arm on a table or countertop. You will slide your arm forward with your thumb facing upward towards the ceiling and lean your body forward until you feel a stretch.

Do these exercises daily with Michelle's free App https://www.pelvic.app These abdominal breathing exercises are a natural remedy for reflux.They reduce upward pressure from the stomach and may strengthen muscles that stop acid rising. Acid reflux causes heartburn and is caused by acid rising from the stomach into the food tube. This acid burns the tissue lining the food tube (oesophagus). Common Causes of Acid Reflux 1. Upward pressure from the belly e.g. holding your abdominal muscles tensed or wearing a tight belt which causes acid to rise up into the food tube (oesophagus). 2. Lack of closing pressure in the barrier at the top of the stomach that stops acid rising. This closing pressure is normally provided by the valve or muscular ring (lower esophageal sphincter or LES) above the stomach. *Always discuss prescribed medication changes with your doctor before changing* If you feel lightheaded or dizzy stop the breathing exercises and resume when recovered. This can happen if you’re accustomed to upper chest breathing rather than abdominal breathing. Step 1 - Setting Up for Breathing Exercises *Loosen your belt or remove tight fitting clothing from around your waist * Correct sitting position for abdominal breathing exercises: - Hips and knees approximately 90 degrees - Feet flat knees slightly apart - Sit with weight even between both sit bones - Normal curve in low back - Chest slightly raised - Lift up through the crown of your head and bring your chin inwards slightly - Relax your shoulders Do these breathing exercises when calm and relaxed. Breathing Exercise 1 (diaphragmatic or abdominal breathing) Rest your right hand on your chest bone and left hand on your upper belly. Breathe in and out slowly through your nose. Breathe in slowly and keep the upper most hand still. You should only feel your lower hand moving in and out as you breathe . Resisted Breathing Exercise 2 (Progression) Press gently with both hands to resist the outward movement of your belly as you breathe in so your breathing muscles need to work harder. Breathing Exercise 3 Place both hands on your sides, at the level of your lower rib cage. Wrap your hands around the sides of your ribcage. Breathe in slowly and deeply just as for breathing exercise No.1. When you breathe in, first your stomach moves forwards and then your hands move out sideways as your ribs expand keeping your chest relaxed. Let the breathe release slowly from your lungs. Resisted Breathing Exercise 4 (Progression) Press your hands slightly against your sides when you breathe in to prevent your lower rib cage from expanding outwards to the sides. Start with your belly moving forwards. There is no need to press the ribs too firmly. If you start moving your chest forwards, stop the exercise and start again. How many exercises and how often * Do the exercises daily * Perform up to 10 breathing exercises in a row starting with exercises 1 and 3 * Progress to resisted breathing exercises 2 and 4 * Repeat up to 10 exercises in a row according to your comfort levels When to do these breathing exercises * Do the exercises before reflux occurs rather than after it has started - Before eating 3 times a day - 10 minutes after eating - If you notice you feel stressed or you are bracing your abdominal muscles * Don't wait until you feel acid reflux burning or heartburn to start your exercises * These reflux exercises are not an instant reflux fix and may only be effective as long as you continue them.

First several weeks postpartum Take short walks and do gentle core exercises such as Kegels and the drawing in maneuver. 2. 6 to 8 weeks postpartum Add gentle, low-impact strengthening such as the clam or bridge exercises. Low-intensity water exercise is also safe at this time, as long as you are no longer experiencing vaginal bleeding. 3. 8 to 12 weeks postpartum Gradually increase exercise intensity, such as including light weight training. 4. 4 to 6 months postpartum Return to more intense exercises such as running, jumping, planks and sit-ups. Waiting 4 to 6 months allows the pelvic floor muscles and abdominals to heal properly after being stretched during pregnancy and delivery. When returning to exercise, monitor your body closely. Contact your OBGYN for guidance or for a referral to pelvic physical therapy if you experience any: • New or worsening pain anywhere in your body • Increased vaginal bleeding • Urinary or fecal leaking • Heaviness in your vaginal region • Bulging, or a ridge along the midline of the abdomen • C-section scar soreness that lasts longer than 2 weeks after birth Learn more about easing into an exercise routine, and how to safely and effectively do 4 postpartum core exercises — Kegels, the drawing in maneuver, the bridge and the clam.

They can also help relieve tension headaches. See Doctor Jo’s blog post about this at: http://www.askdoctorjo.com/relieve-neck-pain First start off with some gentle neck movements to warm up your muscles by turning your head from side to side like you are looking over your shoulder. This is neck rotation. Now you are going to take your ear to your shoulder on each side. Make sure you are not shrugging your shoulders up. This is side bending. Next, the exercise is a simple chin tuck. You don’t want to tuck it down to your chest, but take your chin, and pull it backwards. You can put your finger on your chin, as a target or starting point, and then tuck it in. Hold it for about 3-5 seconds, and then relax. Do this about 3-5 times. Now for a trapezius stretch, place your hand under your thigh to keep your shoulder down, then side bend your head to the opposite side and gently put pressure with your other hand to get a stretch through your trapezius muscles. Hold these for 30 seconds and perform 3 times on each side. Then you will stretch your levator scapulae muscle. This is the muscle that is used when you shrug your shoulders, and they can get overworked when you are stressed out. Take your arm on the side of the pain and place it above and behind your shoulder. Then take your opposite arm and place on top and slightly behind your head. Look down towards the opposite knee of the pain and apply gentle pressure for a good stretch. The next stretch is for the anterior scalene muscles. Cross you hand over to the side you want to stretch and place it on your clavicle to help hold down the first rib where they are attached. Turn your head toward that side and look upward. Hold these for 30 seconds and perform 3 times on each side. The final exercises are isometric exercises that will help strengthen the muscles. You are going to do isometric exercises in each direction. Basically this is when you activate the muscle, but you are not moving it. You can do this by gently pressing into your hand in each direction. Hold each one of these for 3-5 seconds.

The cartilage of a joint can become thin, cracked and frayed, which can in turn lead to pain, inflammation and stiffness. As a result, people with OA of the hip or knee may become less active, leading to physical deconditioning and loss of strength, which in turn contributes to the progression of OA. Fortunately, regular exercise and physical activity can help maintain and increase strength, endurance, and range of motion. In this video, Advanced Practice Physiotherapist Suzanne Denis provides an overview of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee, shares key principles to help you get started on an exercise program, then talks you through a series of exercise demonstrations for your hips, legs and trunk muscles, as well as stretches for each area.","tags":"Arthritis, Arthritis Society, osteoarthritis, OA, activity, exercise, fitness, mobility, Suzanne Denis, physio, physiotherapist, PT, hip, knee, joint, joint replacement","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKQrrCgB8Jg/hqdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY1t66AJzuU","title":"Workout | Home Workout | Workout Routines","description":"Workout or home workout.

If you would like to connect with them we have left their handles in the video. Before exercising it’s very important to always warm up to prevent any injury. Once you're done please don’t forget to cool down with a full stretch routine as well to prevent any injury. If you'd like more information on this, https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/how-to-warm-up-before-exercising/ https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/how-to-stretch-after-exercising/ IMPORTANCE OF STAYING ACTIVE WHILE SOCIAL DISTANCING: Thank you to all of you for staying at home as much as possible and limiting the spread of Covid-19. I know it’s not easy, especially with the good weather ahead but so many of you have been following the rules on social distancing. We’re all in this together and together we can overcome this challenge as we’ve overcome many challenges in the past. While you’re staying at home and social distancing it can be very easy to fall into an unhealthy pattern of behaviour which can make you feel down, demotivated and even dampen your immune system. So please try to stay mentally and physically active. The NHS also have some really useful articles on keeping mental active and lots of general advice on what to do while you’re staying at home. Here are the links to the articles, https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/coronavirus-covid-19-anxiety-tips/ https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/staying-at-home-to-avoid-getting-coronavirus/staying-at-home-and-away-from-other-people/ If you'd like more information on maintaining a healthy immune system with evidence based science.

How to do Kegels Your pelvic floor muscles are located in layers between your legs where you sit. The pelvic floor muscles wrap around the 3 openings in the female pelvic floor. There are 3 steps for doing your Kegel exercises correctly. Step 1. The first step involves tightening the anus as if stopping gas from passing. The anus tightens and buttocks should stay relaxed. Tighten the anus and lift it inwards to feel a squeezing sensation around your anus. Step 2. Tighten and squeeze the entrance to the vagina as if you're closing it shut and at the same time try to lift your vagina inwards. Step 3. Tighten the opening where the urine comes out. You may feel the anus and vagina tightening, if you do this is correct Now relax your pelvic floor muscles back to resting. Combine steps 1-3 for correct Kegel exercise technique *Sit tall *Breathe normally * Tighten your anus and vagina, lift them both in and upwards towards your navel and tighten and squeeze as if you're stopping the flow of urine at the front *Relax your pelvic floor back to resting Test your Kegels: 1. Stop or slow the flow of urine but do this as a test and not an exercise and only once a week. 2. Tighten your pelvic floor as if to stop passing gas when you feel the urge. How Many Kegels for Beginners? Start out during the first couple of days doing 1-2 doing gentle Kegel exercises in a row. Focus on correct technique correct. As your technique improves progress by doing a few more Kegels and start to hold your exercises a little longer. If you can do 2 Kegels in a row for 3 seconds, this is the number of exercises you start with, 2 exercises holding each exercise for 3 seconds. Take a break of up to 10 seconds before doing your next exercise. Try to repeat this routine 3 times a day. Kegels Training Recipe - Intermediate *8 -12 Kegel exercises *Up to 10 seconds/exercise *Rest for 6-10 seconds *Repeat 2-3 times/day *Most days of the week How Long for Strength Results? Some women notice improvements within a couple of weeks of starting their Kegels however it can take 5-6 months to fully strengthen pelvic floor muscles if they're weak to start with. - - - - - - Music by Aiden Kenway: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEeJ...

The same lower back pain physical therapy exercises I give to my patients every single day! ➡️ MY TREATMENT TABLE: https://amzn.to/3wA9AND ➡️ MY THICK EXERCISE MAT: https://amzn.to/3hUvo2D ================================ MORE VIDS YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL: ✅ DECOMPRESS YOUR LOWER BACK AT HOME: https://youtu.be/Mc2o0KjBhkQ ✅ LOW BACK PAIN RELIEF IN SECONDS: https://youtu.be/DxIeqiyYZkQ ✅ UNLOCK YOUR BACK STRETCHING ROUTINE: https://youtu.be/ShRHEbxZ9l0 ✅ FOLLOW-ALONG CORE WORKOUT ROUTINE FOR BEGINNERS: https://youtu.be/b_TTLmmQmXU ================================ Lower back pain is the most-common condition that I treat in my clinic. In fact many experts predict that as many as 80% of us will experience a significant episode of lower back pain in our lives. The thing that not many of these patients realize is that many of them would never be my patients in the first place if they just participated in the right core strengthening exercises. The right core exercises can help eliminate lower back pain now and and strengthen your back to prevent pain from coming back in the future. While this idea isn’t necessarily new, the mistake many people make when they do their core exercises is they only train their abs with sit ups and crunches. Your core is a 3-dimensional structure and we need to focus on all four sides of the core wall (front, back, left, and right). Exercising all of these areas will add strength to your core and stability to your back to help you to feel better fast… and even PREVENT lower back pain from showing up in the future. These are the same four exercises I give to my physical therapy patients every single day. I know they’re incredibly effective and I know they can work for you, too! I’ve included progressions to each one of these exercises to you can customize them to meet your individual unique needs. The goal is to challenge yourself, but not make the exercises so hard that you can’t get through all the recommended sets and reps. Good luck, and I hope you feel better fast! ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️ 1:34 BRIDGES - great way to work the lower back with the hips to strengthen through extension. 2:35 SINGLE-LEG BRIDGES - progress the standard bridge with a single=-leg 2:58 MODIFIED PLANKS - woks all the layers of you ab muscles; be sure to engage your deep core. 4:04 FULL PLANKS - progress the modified planks with full planks when strength allows 4:37 SIDELYING ABDUCTION - keep your stomach “sucked in” and engaged while lifting your straight leg out to the side. 5:40 MODIFIED SIDE PLANK - progress into modified side planks and 5:56 FULL SIDE PLANK - progress into full side planks to continue to challenge your lateral core muscles. 6:21 BIRD DOGS - great stabilization exercise for your entire back ✅ Be sure to LIKE this video above ✅ SUBSCRIBE to Tone and Tighten here on YouTube ✅ COMMENT your experience above","tags":"Prevent back pain, prevent lower back pain, low back pain, low back pain exercises, lower back pain, lower back pain relief, lower back pain exercises, exercises for back pain, exercises for low back pain, exercises for lower back pain, core exercises, core exercises for back pain","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lqn87bWvwps/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEyLWigabCI","title":"One Simple Exercise Routine To Tone Your Flabby Arms | Better | NBC News","description":"Celebrity personal trainer Chris Powell has an easy exercise routine to tone flabby arms.» Subscribe to NBC News: http://nbcnews.to/SubscribeToNBC » Watch more NBC video: http://bit.ly/MoreNBCNews NBC News Digital is a collection of innovative and powerful news brands that deliver compelling, diverse and engaging news stories.

If so - not to worry! You’re absolutely not alone! Flat feet in and of themselves are not necessarily a bad thing. Many people who have flat feet live out their whole lives completely normal with no problems or complications. But there certainly are those who have flat feet who experience a lot of problems because of them. These problems can include (but certainly aren’t limited to) plantar fasciitis, knee pain (patellar tracking), hip pain, and lower back pain. If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms and you have flat feet, oftentimes addressing this issue can help you to feel better in a hurry. CAN EXERCISE FIX MY FLAT FEET? The bottom line is most flat feet are caused by bone and ligament structure in your foot. Unfortunately no amount of exercise will ever change the anatomical structure of your foot. However what you CAN do is improve the STRENGTH and STABILITY of the muscles that act on the bones of your foot to add support and improve movement mechanics! And those are exactly the exercises you’re going to get in this video!

This can be very painful, and sometimes people have a difficult time walking with it. Often people will have the worst pain in the morning when they first walk. The pain can be in the bottom of the foot, the arch of the foot, and/or the heel. There are several stretches to help relieve the pain. First you are going to stretch your calf muscle, or gastrocnemius muscle. Keep your leg straight, and take the belt or leash and place it on the ball of your foot. Relax your leg and then pull your foot towards you. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, 3 times. Next, you want to massage the tissue, or fascia on the bottom of your foot. Use circular and spreading motions, and apply more pressure where you feel knots. These next stretches you can do sitting. The best time is right before you get out of bed because many people have the most pain when they first put weight on their feet in the morning. You can use a noodle or foam roll, and place it under your foot. Roll lightly at first, and then apply more pressure if it is not too painful. You can also take a water bottle and freeze it. This will give you an ice massage while you are stretching the fascia when rolling it under your foot. The last stretch you can do standing on a step or curb. Place the ball of your foot on the edge of the step and relax your heel downwards. This will stretch your fascia and your calf. Hold for 30 seconds and do it 3 times.

The major hip flexor muscle is two muscles combined called the iliopsoas. These muscles work to move your upper thigh (femur) to your chest. When this muscle is injured, it can cause pain even with walking. Here are some stretches for your hip flexors. First start in a kneeling position. Place the knee of the hip flexor you want to stretch on the ground, and take the opposite leg and bend it in front of you at a ninety-degree angle. You might want to place a pillow under your knee to protect it. You will be in a lunge position with the knee of your injured side on the ground. Now drive the knee of the uninjured side forward away from your body. Hold for 30 seconds, and do this 3 times. Next, you will be on your stomach, or in prone. Bring your foot of the injured side towards your buttocks and grab your ankle. Gently pull your foot towards your buttocks and then lift your thigh off the ground pushing your leg up in the air. To help lift your hip, push your foot away into your hand. Hold for 30 seconds and do it 3 times. Finally, lie down on your bed or a high surface. You will need good balance for this so you won't fall off the bed. Slide to the side of the bed with the injured side hanging off the edge. Now bend the opposite knee towards your chest and hold onto it. Just relax your leg off the side and you should feel a stretch. Hold for 30 seconds and do it 3 times.

Feel the position of your sit bones when you sit. Your pelvic floor muscles are located between your sit bones inside (not outside) your pelvis.

They are easy to do just about anywhere and should help provide pain relief from carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms.

The first two stretches for carpal tunnel syndrome are more of a warm up. You will make a fist, and do wrist flexion and extension. Then you will turn your fist up with the thumb on top for radial and unlar deviation. These will start loosening up the muscles in and around the wrist. Then you will go into full stretches for your wrist flexors and extensors. You can do them modified or the full stretch. The next carpal tunnel stretch is a prayer stretch. This really stretches the carpal tunnel area, and you might get some numbness and tingling with it. As long as it goes away when you stop, it should be okay to do. The last two stretches are for your pec or chest muscles and your anterior scalenes. Sometimes the pain comes from tightness in these areas at the chest and neck. So it’s important to stretch this area as well.

You have seven vertebrae in your neck. In instances where the head comes forward, the bottom vertebrae (lowest in your neck) tends to protrude out the back and become a little more prominent. Because this becomes an area of high pressure, your body lays down extra fat in that area to protect it. This gives the appearance of this “neck hump” or “hunchback” posture. WHY DO YOU GET NECK HUMP? At its core, this “neck hump” is really a posture issue. Your head should normal sit squarely on top of your shoulders, but when it doesn’t that can lead to problems. As your head comes forward and your shoulders start to round inward, your 7th vertebrae becomes more and more pronounced resulting in this “hump” or “bump”. Your body then starts to build up fat tissue around it to protect and cushion it which contributes even more to the problem. HOW TO GET RID OF NECK HUMP/HUNCHBACK POSTURE The best thing you can do to eliminate this “neck hump” is to correct your posture. If you can get your head seated squarely on top of your neck and over your shoulders, the neck hump will resolve on its own. HOW TO CORRECT YOUR NECK POSTURE. This is best accomplished with consistent performance of the following three home exercise techniques: vertebrae mobilization, stretching areas of tightness, and strengthening your postural muscles to maintain this good alignment. 1️⃣ MOBILIZE THE VERTEBRAE A simple pair of rolled-up socks works very well. This can be done in supine or standing and I also demonstrate a technique using a foam roller. (2:13) SUPINE MOBILIZATION TECHNIQUE (3:14) STANDING MOBILIZATION TECHNIQUE (3:53) FOAM ROLLER MOBILIZATION TECHNIQUE 2️⃣ STRETCH TIGHT MUSCLES The muscles in your upper neck, chest, and shoulders tend to get tight and pull you forward into a rounded position. Stretching these will help with your neck hump appearance. (4:59) CHIN TUCKS STRETCHING (6:14) DOORWAY PECTORAL STRETCH 3️⃣ STRENGTHEN POSTURE Strengthening the muscles in your back and shoulders will help to keep you in a good position to not only eliminate neck hump now, but prevent it from coming back in the future.

Michelle from https://www.pelvicexercises.com.au shows you deep breathing exercises in 4 simple steps for improving oxygen uptake, recovering from illness or surgery and reducing stress and fatigue. Deep Breathing Exercise Technique\\r Step 1\\r Starting Position\\r • Start sitting, standing or lying down with your body supported by a couple of pillows.\\r • Place one hand on your upper abdomen just below your rib cage and the other hand at the side of your chest on the lower part of your rib cage.\\r Step 2\\r Posture\\r If you're sitting or standing raise the crown of your head towards the ceiling, raise your chest and relax your shoulders away from your ears.\\r Step 3\\r Rib Cage Movement\\r • Breathe in slowly and feel your rib cage expand sideways\\r • Keep your upper chest and shoulders relaxed \\r • Breathe out by letting your rib cage fall back to resting.\\r Step 4\\r Abdominal Movement\\r You should feel a gentle rise and fall of your belly beneath your hand as you breath in and out.\\r Progressing Deep Breathing Exercises\\r Progress your deep breathing exercises by doing them standing upright and without placing your hands on your rib cage.\\r \\r Deep Breathing Exercise Technique\\r When you breathe in deeply your diaphragm contracts and moves further downwards into your abdomen than it would with regular breathing. This downward movement creates a vacuum inside your chest causing air to enter and fill up your lungs. Your diaphragm relaxes when you breathe out allowing air to passively leave your lungs.\\r Benefits of Deep Breathing Exercises\\r Deep breathing can benefit your overall health by:\\r • Increasing your lung capacity (the amount of air that enters your lungs)\\r • Improving circulating oxygen levels\\r • Reducing fatigue with exercise\\r • Decreasing blood pressure\\r • Reducing stress and anxiety\\r • Improving core deep abdominal and pelvic floor muscle function\\r \\r Music by Aiden Kenway: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEeJ... –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– Disclaimer The information provided in this video is intended as general information and not a substitute for individual medical advice regarding your medical condition.

Tension headaches, neck pain, upper back and shoulder pain, and even low back pain can often be attributed to poor posture. Luckily there is a lot that the right stretches and exercises can do to correct your poor posture and help you out of the pain you might be experiencing. In this video I will share with you two of my favorite posture routines – one for your neck and upper back and another for your lower back. These routines have helped countless of my patients and I hope they help you, too! The key to correcting your posture is to STRETCH THE AREAS THAT HAVE BECOME TIGHT AND STRENGTHEN THE AREAS THAT HAVE BECOME WEAK. These are the best exercises and these are the best routines to help you to accomplish that! BEST EXERCISES TO CORRECT NECK AND UPPER BACK POSTURE *Stretch where it’s tight: we need to stretch the neck extensor muscles as well as the chest and anterior shoulders. *Strengthen where it’s weak: we need to strengthen the deep neck flexors as well as the muscles between your shoulder blades.

(10:45) These routines should be performed daily in order to yield maximum results. You should also be mindful of your posture throughout the day to maximize the efficacy of these programs. HOW LONG UNTIL I SEE MY POSTURE IMPROVE? Consistency is key! Some people will see postural improvements in as little as 2-4 weeks; but for most it will be the 8-12 weeks range. Some may require 14-16 weeks to see improvement. The key is to remain consistent with them and keep in mind that it took a long time for these changes to occur; it will take some work to reverse them.","tags":"posture routine, posture exercises, posture workout, best posture exercises, fix your posture, how to fix your posture, best exercises for posture, home routine for posture, fix neck posture, fix back posture, fix nerd neck, fix forward head, fix hunchback, fix back hump, fix arched back, home posture routine, fix my posture, posture, improve posture, physical therapy, jared beckstrand, tone and tighten","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jB1Yb9PMm-U/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixNpHAP84dU","title":"my realistic 5am morning routine (gym edition)","description":"my 5am morning routine: skincare, get ready with me, journaling, breakfast, gym workout (cardio \\u0026 abs) \\u0026 breakfast number 2. realistic, productive and calm!

Colombia has the fourth biggest economy, in light of GDP, in all of South America. The Colombian economy became 3.1% in 2015, is on target to become another 2.5% in 2016, and the Central Bank of Colombia predicts a 2% development for 2017. It is driven by fares of petrol, emeralds, minerals, bananas, espresso, and cut blossoms. (70% of the cut blossoms imported by the U.S. come from Colombia.) Late years have seen significant changes in the petrol business in Colombia. A diminishing in both per-barrel creation and cost per barrel has been the main consideration in producing the most minimal financial development rates since the 2009 emergency. In spite of the fact that oil trades address just 5% of GDP, they represent 20% of the public authority's income. This has driven the public authority to give an assessment change proposition. #Google.com For any business enquiry \\u0026 copyright issue: bithy723@gmail.com All Footage are collect from videoblocks premium account.

The center-right and the country's traditional political class in general were wiped off the map. The former mayor of Medellin, Federico Gutierrez, or Fico, the center-right candidate who attracted the support of forces such as the U Party, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, Radical Change and the Democratic Center, did not even make it to the second round. Having the backing of Colombian political heavyweights such as Cesar Gaviria, Andres Pastrana and even Alvaro Uribe – not to mention President Ivan Duque himself – did him absolutely no good. Now, what could explain such an electoral turnaround in Colombia, and why have the center-right and Uribism received such a thrashing?

In this video, we will analyze Colombia's economic indicators, discuss how geography influences infrastructure and compare Colombia's economic data with that of USA and Haiti. Remember, when we look at economic data and determine a country's level of development, we are leaving a lot out of the conversation as to why a country has the level of development they have. History and current events have a huge role in a country's economy! We also never use judgment words to describe a country's economy—such as good or bad, right or wrong. A developed country does not always mean 'good' and 'happy.' These are relative words, as there are many times people are 'happy' with less. This is just setting up the groundwork so you can have more intelligent conversations about economy as you continue your education!

Many issues pose enormous challenges for this country’s future and stability. In this context, on August 7th 2018, Ivan Duque was sworn in as President of Colombia with a very ambitious promise given the circumstances: to get the country in shape and prepare it for a rapid development process. Since Iván Duque rose to power, enough time has passed for us here on VisualPolitik to ask ourselves some questions: What is the true political strategy of Duque’s government? That is, how do they aim to transform Colombia? Can they do what they say? What could be the legacy of his passage through Casa Nariño – the Colombian White House? In this video we’ll explain the foundations of Ivan Duque's economic strategy and how he aims to transform Colombia.

Pero, por otro lado, si se compara la Colombia de hoy con la de hace 20 años, se puede ver que ha mejorado casi en cualquier indicador socioeconómico. Sin embargo, algunos quieren vender la falsa idea de que Colombia está al borde del abismo, sin esperanza o incluso llegándolo a comparar con Venezuela. Este tipo de práctica es hasta cierto punto normal de los políticos; lo que sí es extraño es que millones, que por lo general tienen una vida cómoda, están creyendo esa idea fatalista sobre Colombia. Una de las características de la economía colombiana es un activo intangible muy valioso que la gran mayoría ignora o no tiene conocimiento sobre él; se trata de la independencia del banco central, que a su vez ha permitido tener controlada la inflación promedio en los últimos 20 años. La tasa de inflación promedio en Colombia fue del 4.4% entre 2002 y 2021 y parece que la mayoría no le importa esto porque precisamente no han experimentado una inflación de 2 o 3 dígitos, es decir, como en Colombia la alta inflación no fue un gran problema en los últimos 20 años, entonces lo dan como un hecho pero es algo que puede cambiar rápidamente si se pierde la independencia del banco central. De manera que las preguntas son: ¿cuál es la propuesta del candidato presidencial Gustavo Petro que acabaría con la mejor característica de la economía colombiana? ¿qué pasó en otros países cuando se implementó esta idea? Y, ¿qué pasó en Colombia hace unos cuantos años cuando se hizo lo mismo que hoy propone Gustavo Petro?

According to the Venezuela based investigative agency. trade in 2014 of $2.4 billion has fallen to about $406 million. of which $331 million is imported from Colombia. The group estimates activity this year could reach $800 million if borders remain closed. but could go up to $1.2 billion if gates reopen to traffic.

Venezuelans are fleeing their home because of a severe economic crisis under President Nicolas Maduro. There are high inflation rates and there isn’t enough food available for people within Venezuela to even eat. Thousands of Venezuelans cross the Simon Bolivar bridge located at Cúcuta every day and Colombia doesn’t seem to be turning anyone way.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. It has the largest known oil reserves in the world and its democratic government was once praised world wide. But today, Venezuela’s democratic institutions and its economy are in shambles.The country has the highest inflation in the world, making food and medicine inaccessible to most Venezuelans. Over the last four years, its GDP has fallen 35%, which is a sharper drop than the one seen during the Great Depression in the US. The country’s murder rate has surpassed that of the most dangerous cities in the world. These conditions have sparked months of protests against the president, Nicolas Maduro. And it’s easy to see why: the country has become measurably worse since his election in 2013.

Desde 1961 hasta 2019, Colombia sólo tuvo un año en el que su economía decreció. En otras palabras, en los últimos 60 años, sólo en 1999 el crecimiento económico fue negativo. En ese año el país vivió una grave crisis inmobiliaria y financiera que provocó la intervención de numerosos establecimientos de crédito y un aumento en la tasa de desempleo que alcanzó niveles del 20%. Por eso, las preguntas a responder son: ¿Cómo se originó la crisis del 1999? ¿Qué tan cerca está Colombia de repetir la burbuja inmobiliaria de esa época?

The government is spending 131 percent of what it receives on transfers and interests from the debt. That means that for every 100 pesos it receives from taxes it still needs 30 pesos to cover the expenses.\\r SUPER CAPTION: Ernesto Samper, President of Colombia\\r \\r The economic emergency will allow the President to circumvent Congress to enact the economic decrees.\\r \\r Samper said the government must cut one (b) billion dollars from this year's budget to help fill a 4-point-4 (b) billion dollars deficit forecast for 1997.\\r \\r Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo announced the first measure - a six percent tax on businesses which aims to devalue the Colombian peso and increase exports.\\r \\r SOUNDBITE: (Spanish)\\r The avalanche of imports produced by the opening (of the economy) was not followed by an increase in exports which led to a greater external debt and consequently to a greater reevaluation which complicated even more the possibilities of the exporting sector.\\r SUPER CAPTION: Ernesto Samper, President of Colombia\\r \\r Despite the emergency, the President gave an optimistic view of the future of foreign investment.\\r \\r SOUNDBITE: (Spanish)\\r The fact that during a year characterised by political uncertainty, foreign investment reached more than 3,500 (m) millions of dollars a record number in the last ten years and that the indexes for financial risk in Colombia were not decreased, shows that despite certain difficulties we still count with a positive margin of international trust.\\r SUPER CAPTION: Ernesto Samper, President of Colombia\\r \\r Reaction to the measures were mixed Tuesday, but overall the business sector has given the thumbs-up to the decrees.\\r \\r SOUNDBITE: (Spanish)\\r We believe the Finance Minister is honouring its commitments, we also believe that all Colombians must accept what has been proposed and we see that these measures are positive.\\r SUPER CAPTION: Maria Isabel Patino, Representative ASOCOFLORES, Flower Industry Guild\\r \\r SOUNDBITE: (Spanish)\\r That imports be decreased is something I think it's complicated.

Control Risks’ Silvana Amaya described this year’s election as being one full of “possibilities of change,” particularly as a response to recent social unrest, the drastic effects of the pandemic, among other major events affecting Colombia. Additionally, Amaya stressed the importance of having a strong and cohesive congress to ensure a proper system of checks and balances. On controlling risk, Amaya cited security is a primary concern, highlighting the possibility of cyberattacks and the need for resilient institutions to withstand these threats. XP Investments’ Alberto Bernal added that there was an additional component of uncertainty and skepticism generated by the COVID-19 pandemic which contributed to the pessimism and overall dynamic of this year’s election. Bernal projected that Colombia’s growth would be 6.5 percent in 2022, compared to 10.7 percent in 2021, which would signal a major outperformance of market projections. Renzo Merino from Moody’s Investors Service discussed Colombia’s fiscal reforms and cited the change of status of Moody’s credit rating for Colombia from negative to stable last October. Merino warned that future changes in Colombia’s fiscal policies could have effects on its credit ratings in the future, and suggested that, beyond Colombia’s fiscal reform, the country should look to attracting investments and focusing on pensions to improve Colombia’s economic outlook.

Even three years after the peace treaty, there is no clear answer. The documentary charts the ongoing conflict between the FARC guerillas and government, which is still fueled by war and social inequality. Bogotá, 2016: the year that will go down in Colombian history books. After some five decades of civil war, the Marxist FARC guerrillas and the government signed a historic peace agreement before eyes of the world. It could have ended not only the armed conflict, but also the yawning gap between rich and poor in Colombia. A nationwide referendum at the beginning of October 2016 was supposed to give the government democratic legitimacy for the move and approval was considered certain. But then the unbelievable happened: The Colombian population rejected the agreement with the FARC rebels by a wafer-thin majority. It was a huge shock for the South American country, where the civil war had cost at least 220,000 lives and made six million people homeless. After nationwide student demonstrations, a new, revised peace treaty was finally signed in November 2016. Filmmaker Uli Stelzner followed the dramatic events of 2016 and the difficult process of implementing the agreement. Colombia may officially be at peace, but the country still knows no rest. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Nevertheless Colombia also is one of the most progressive countries. After its LGBT legislation (http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/inicio/Constitucion%20politica%20de%20Colombia.pdf) it is possible to change sex, marry a partner of same sex and also adopt children. I received Felipe Cardenas, President of the chamber of commerce LGBT of Bogota (www.cclgbt.co). He is talking about the Colombian economy, the Colombian LGBT movement (https://colombiadiversa.org) and the biggest challenges Colombia faces today. Further he talks about investment opportunities and that for real investors the sexual preference of a person does not matter but the business opportunity. We learn that foreign direct investments to Colombia currently are focused to hospitality services with Hotels as the main investment objects. He also explains his favorite LGBT travel destinations in Colombia (https://www.pelecanus.com.co/places-to-visit-in-colombia/). For members of the LGBT community he recommends Bogota, as it offers the most in whole Colombia (https://bogota.gov.co/mi-ciudad). The second one is Medellin (https://www.medellin.gov.co) as the government is currently investing a lot into diverse offers. The third destination is Cartagena (https://www.cartagena.gov.co) that also has a great pride parade. The fourth destination is the coffee triangle (https://www.pelecanus.com.co/places-to-visit-in-colombia/coffee-belt-region/) as in terms of beauty it is unbeaten.

This improbable – and dangerous – task is perhaps the best way of tackling the wild legacy left by Pablo Escobar, the country’s most notorious drug lord. Because the four hippos he imported in the 1980s and abandoned in his hacienda zoo have become a serious cause for environmental concern... In this video, we explore Colombia’s unusual wildlife problem: hippos, which are native to sub-Saharan Africa, are flourishing in the tropical heat near Medellín. But what impact are they really having on the local ecosystem? And is there any way to halt a biodiversity calamity?

In this address to the IIEA, Vice President Ramirez discusses Colombia’s work in promoting economic and social reconstruction strategies to strengthen female participation. She also highlights Colombia’s experience during the Venezuelan refugee crisis. Colombia has taken in over 1.8 million Venezuelan refugees, 50% of which are women, and offered them temporary protective status. Vice President Ramirez describes how, using a gender-based approach, the Colombian strategy has enabled Venezuelan refugees to contribute to Colombian society and to access healthcare and other essential services. This event was co-organised with the Embassy of Colombia in Ireland. About the Speaker: Marta-Lucía Ramírez is the first woman to be elected and serve as Deputy Head of State and Government (Vice President) in the history of Colombia. In that capacity, she has sought to improve transparency, fight corruption, achieve gender equity, improve infrastructure, and increase economic growth. In May 2021 she was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia. Previously, she served as Colombia’s Minister of Trade (1998), Colombian Ambassador to France (2002), Minister of Defence (2002-2003) and Senator (2006-2009). As the first and only woman to have served as Minister of Defence she created the Armed Forces’ School of Human Rights and sought to promote women in service by allowing them to reach the rank of general for the first time in Colombian history.

What started as a protest against a tax reform has turned into a full-blown conflict that has left dozens of civilian and police casualties. The Colombian government, led by Iván Duque, has had to withdraw this tax reform. However, the protests continue, this time to denounce the excesses of the Colombian authorities. It is clear that Colombia is an extremely violent country. Drug lords, terrorist groups and paramilitary groups have forced the state to militarize its police. Now Colombia has to modernize its security forces. But that's more complicated than it sounds. Why does Colombia have so much political opposition to modernizing its police and military? What is the Damascus Doctrine? What is the underlying problem in Colombia's protests? In this video we tell you.

In this video, we will examine the significant strides that Mexico, Peru, Colombia, and Chile have made in the 21st century and what those advances could mean for their chances of emerging as a focal point of further global economic growth. By joining forces, these four Pacific coast countries stand poised to increase the group's global impact as a whole. Despite the most recent growth that the Pumas have experienced, a plethora of challenges remains on the horizon, including drug violence, falling copper prices, and protests, each presenting the potential to derail future expansion. Discover what must be done to overcome those challenges and what is on the line for the Pumas to emerge as regional leaders in Latin America and trail blazers for the rest of the world. _________________ Do you like the video?

The ever-uncontrollable border between Columbia and Venezuela. It’s a paradise for cartels, except here, it’s not the traffic of cocaine, but of petrol. Venezuela is the country of black gold, home to one quarter of the world’s petrol reserves. With the fall in the price of petrol, the economy has collapsed, and Venezuelans are now spread as thinly as ever. Many have been retrained in the traffic of petrol. After buying the fuel in Venezuela, they then re-sell it at thirty times the price in Columbia… Everyday they cross the border on foot, lugging 50-litre tanks on their backs. This is a high-risk form of trafficking, as on the other side of the border lies the Venezuelan military, all too ready to fire.

By following these steps, you can make ANY kind of website, just by using “DRAG \\u0026 DROP” Steps you need to follow (with timestamp): 1) Choose a Domain Name 2) Buy Hosting \\u0026 Domain 3) Install WordPress 4) Add a New Theme 5) Edit the Content We’re going to build our website by following these 5 steps. So, Let’s Start. Step 1: Pick a name for your website First, you need to go to: http://itsthor.com/ and then pick a name for your website. You can choose anything like - mywebsite.com, or .in, or .net, or .org. This will be the domain name of your website. So, pick one and check whether it’s available or not! Once you get it, you can go to the next step. Step 2: Get Hosting \\u0026 Domain Hosting \\u0026 Domain are the two things that you need, for launching your website. Hosting is the place where your website’s files get stored and Domain is the name of your website. Step 3: Installing WordPress Wordpress is a free tool that can be installed and used to build a website without having any knowledge of programming or coding. To Install WordPress, go to your hosting account and click “Managed WordPress.” Create a WordPress Login by entering a username and password. (This will be used to logging into WordPress) After the WordPress Installation is complete, you’ll then be taken to your WordPress Dashboard. Now, this is the place from where you’ll be controlling your website. When you reach this page, your website will be LIVE! So, you can quickly check it, by entering your domain name. Now, to visit your WordPress Dashboard again, you can just type: yoursite.com/login. Your website will now have a default WordPress Theme. You can change it, by going to the next step. Step 4: Adding a New Theme You can install a new theme by going to ‘Themes.’ You can install the Astra theme (To get pre-made website designs with demo content) Also, install the Astra Sites Plugin (which comes with the Astra theme) that will make it easy for you to customise your site. You can install this plugin, by going to ‘Plugins.’ Now, this plugin has a set of designs for your website, which you can choose \\u0026 then apply it to your site. To choose the designs, you can click ‘See Library.’ Now, before you select a design, make sure you click ‘Elementor’ which will make it easy for you to edit the design. So, choose the design and import it to your site. Once, you’ve got the design with its demo content, you can then go to the final step. Step 5: Editing the Demo Content Editing a page is very very easy. To edit a page, just go into the page that you want to edit and click ‘Elementor.’ You’ll then go to an editing section. Now, to edit any text, just select it, and type anything you want. This process works throughout the website. This is how, you can edit any page you want, using Elementor. Now, if you want to edit the header and the footer area of your website, you can simply click ‘Customise.’ After you click,’Customise.’ You’ll see some blue icons on on the page. To edit anything, like the logo or the menu section, just click the blue icon and make your changes. The same works-out in the footer area, also. Now, to create a new page, you can use 2 methods: 1) Create your OWN page by dragging and dropping elements using Elementor. 2) Use pre-made designs using Templates. That’s it! This is how easily you can launch your website. So just, - Get your Hosting \\u0026 Domain - Import the Demo Content - \\u0026 Edit it to make your OWN Website.

The second reason is to bring back the fun and joy of coding your own web site from scratch without using any fancy technologies or frameworks. And the third reason is to use this web site as my own personal information organizational tool. So I can keep some of the most important thoughts, skills that I'm trying to develop, quotes and articles organized. I'm also using it as a launchpad for my new project called Life Craft which is a YouTube channel and a web site for personal development. The web development field is filled with all kinds of languages and technologies and many people start learning the latest frameworks without even understanding what they are for. Knowing these latest programming languages can be good if you're looking to get hired, but Clever Techie is more about the passion of coding your own projects, building your own web sites. In this video I'd like to bring back that passion of creating your own web site, while understanding every piece of code that you write and only adding and upgrading technology if necessary.

(1) You need a domain + Hosting package To purchase , Please visit following link. https://resellerclubcom.sjv.io/L9An0 Most of the hosting providers giving discounts only if you select long time packages. But in reseller club, Even if you select 3 months, they offer some great discounts. Thats why I select them. Also you can get un-metered disk space plus bandwidth . Unlimited email accounts and free c panel. Full package is there. So just give it a try. https://resellerclubcom.sjv.io/L9An0 You can purchase a domain from there as well. If you purchase a domain from somewhere else, You need to update the name servers as I mentioned in the video. Once you are done with it, You can install word press on your reseller club hosting with one click, thanks to the c panel. Once you are done with it, time to customise your own website. Congratulations ! Now you have your own website.

You will not only create an amazing WordPress website, but you will become a pro in Elementor Pro. After watching this tutorial you are able to create websites for clients. I did my best to show you as much as possible without making this a 7-hour tutorial. Elementor Pro is in my opinion the best premium page builder there is. It gives you the ability to create every single aspect of your website. That is why you don't need a theme for it. Normally you use a page builder in combination with a theme. That can cause problems since they can have overlapping settings. With Elementor Pro and the empty theme Hello (made by Elementor), you can create everything from scratch. And that is what I will show you in this video. How to create your own header, footer, blogpost template, blog archive template. We will cover a lot! We also talk about importing pre-made optimized templates so you can save yourself a ton of time! After watching this tutorial you do not only have a website, but you will have a ton of knowledge about creating websites with Elementor Pro.

Because I spent more time at home last year, I became less active and less aware of the foods I was eating. I consumed a lot of unhealthy junk foods, and gradually, I began to gain weight and my body began to feel sluggish and unhealthy. I am the heaviest I’ve ever been in my entire life, and I’m becoming really uncomfortable with the way my body feels, so I’ve decided to commit to a healthier lifestyle by exercising more and eating healthier. As usual, I went to Food TikTok to gather some meal prep ideas and also to inspire me to eat cleaner and healthier. TikTok has made it easier for me to come up with healthier, low-calorie meals without sacrificing delicious foods. I’ve also really enjoyed discovering new foods and recipes to try out. Because of my healthier and cleaner diet (and exercise!), my body is beginning to feel better, and I am also more energetic! I’ve compiled a series of healthy food TikToks which consist of my favorite food TikTokers in hopes that it will help anyone else who‘s struggling with their health, weight, or mood or anyone who needs healthy food inspiration to aid in getting their health back on track. I hope you enjoy the video! If you like this video or all things TikTok, be sure to like and subscribe to our channel for more TikTok content!

Choose Dark Chocolate Over Milk Chocolate - 10:17 Music: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music https://www.epidemicsound.com/ Summary: 1. Sweeten With Cinnamon Not Sugar Starting off with one of the most obvious steps any diet requires you to implement. Cutting down on sugar. But what about those sudden sweet cravings? Cinnamon has a hint of sweetness to it which can trick your brain into thinking you are having something sweet and that intense craving will be successfully managed. Sprinkle some cinnamon on porridge or sweet oats for a healthier alternative to sugar. 2. Choose Fresh Fruit Over Dehydrated Dehydrated fruit is healthy. It's said to contain as many nutrients as whole fresh fruit. However, if calorie cutting is your aim then dehydrated fruit should be skipped. 3. Sip Seltzer Not Soda Did you know that a glass of seltzer water with a drop of lemon wedge is zero calories while a can of coke contains 140 calories? If you have been thinking about making the switch to healthy eating, soda is another thing you need to quit. Making the switch to seltzer water will ease up this process and satisfy the cravings for drinking soda. 4. Swap White Pasta For Whole Wheat Regular white pasta is something you must steer clear of. Stripped of nutrients and made from refined carbs, it adds some serious calories per serving. On the other hand making the switch to whole wheat pasta will prove to be a much more nutritious option. As opposed to white pasta, it contains complex carbs, fiber, protein, zinc and iron.

Healthy Food ideas","description":"Bulgur wheat (Also known as kind of Dalia in Northern India) is a whole wheat grain that has been cracked and partially pre-cooked. As a whole grain, it is a naturally high-fiber, low-fat, low-calorie vegetarian and vegan food ingredient.Though bulgur wheat is most commonly found in tabouli (tabbouleh) salad, you can use it just like rice or couscous, or any other whole grain, such as barley or quinoa. A cup of burgol has fewer calories, less fat, and more than twice the fiber of brown rice. After cooking, it increases in volume. Burgol doesn't lose much from its minimal processing; it remains high in protein and minerals. That means it's an ideal foundation for meals, allowing you to skip higher-fat protein sources, like most meats. Burgol is also a standout in terms of its fiber content, just like whole wheat, and can help keep your digestive tract healthy as a result. The insoluble fiber it contains absorbs water, promoting faster elimination of waste, which prevents the formation of an environment that promotes the development of carcinogens.

Do you find it hard to cook for the family after a busy day at work? Sometimes we don't know what to cook for dinner. Why not try cooking one pot meals for the family? One Pot Beef And Rice Recipe, also known as One Pot Biryani Recipe. Many historians believe that biryani originated from Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals. Biryani was further developed in the Mughal royal kitchen. The Mughal soldiers looked undernourished. In order to provide a balanced diet to the soldiers, she asked the chefs to prepare dish with meat and rice. Fragrant basmati rice layered with spicy and delicious beef curry. Biryani has two main components: fluffy, fragrant basmati rice and a delicious saucy beef (or your choice of protein) curry or masala, and, it’s super delicious. Why is balanced diet important? A balanced diet supplies the nutrients your body needs to work effectively. Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and low performance. Children who don't get enough healthy foods may face growth and developmental problems, poor academic performance, and frequent infections. Benefits of One-pot meals: 1️⃣ Increase the opportunity to incorporate vegetables into sauces or within a dish. 2️⃣ Increase nutrition by fortifying the less nutrient-dense ingredients. 3️⃣ Increase exposure to potentially non-preferred foods, which is associated with decreased picky eating and healthier eating habits in the future. 4️⃣ Provide the opportunity to expose a child to a variety of food textures and consistencies which promotes oral motor skills and is associated with healthier eating habits and reduced picky eating.

I will upload a step by step video illustration on this one pot beef and rice recipe soon. I hope to share more recipes with you.

The people at Everytable believe that healthy food isn’t a luxury product to be enjoyed by the most affluent, but rather, it is a human right that should be accessible to all. So they came up with a radical business model that enables them to sell healthy fast food in low-income communities and food deserts. Their main strategy? Meals are priced differently based on the neighborhood in which they’re sold. \\r See the full article on this healthy fast food startup here: https://www.freethink.com/videos/healthy-fast-food \\r \\r You might also like... -Did the Food Pyramid Make us Fat? https://youtu.be/AjhJJ4jq4_o -The Student Laboratory Reinventing Food To Stop Waste: https://youtu.be/1AKWW8HgjM4 \\r Follow Freethink.\\r -Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/freethinkmedia\\r -Twitter: https://twitter.com/freethinkmedia\\r -Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/freethink\\r -Website: http://www.freethink.com\\r \\r Join the Freethink forum: http://www.facebook.com/groups/freethinkforum","tags":"food delivery, food delivery service, healthy food, healthy fast food, food desert, food delivery services, healthy fast food options, food deserts, emergency food, fast food delivery, fresh food delivery, healthy food delivery, cheapest food delivery, cheap healthy food, home food delivery, healthy fast food restaurants, Healthy restaurants, healthiest fast food options, healthy eating, fast food, fast food diet, food shortage, food poverty, everytable, los angeles","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tmb7wlK8YO8/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKO62rRN39E","title":"LongLivVintage | Healthy Food Recipes 3","description":"Hi Lovelies!

Choose an assortment of healthy ingredients for vibrant meals and balanced nutrition that's utterly convenient for work or school. The best part? You often don't need to heat them up. So all you have to do is open the box, dig in, and enjoy. Because I love to meal prep, I also chose salads, snacks, and other recipes that are durable and can be meal prepped, saving you time in the kitchen throughout the week.

I feel like the term brighter skin can often be a little confusing, what does it really mean, why do we want it?! To me and to many brands, brighter skin means healthier-looking skin, a more even tone and texture, hydrated, dewy. Dull is the opposite of brighter. My dull skin is often dry, uneven, often dehydrated but also oily. One ingredient I like for this is vitamin C, but if you are familiar with my channel and myself you know I’m not keen on a lot of vitamin c serums! Luckily the sponsor of today's video MURAD has a whole selection of vitamin c products that can help us achieve brighter healthier skin. And today in I’ll be showcasing the newwwww vita-c triple exfoliating facial. ✖ Instagram - @james_s_welsh ✖ Twitter - @james_s_welsh PRODUCTS IN THIS VIDEO (*= affiliate link) ICON MEANINGS: Present - Gifted Item (Product was sent to me as a gift, no money has been exchanged and there is no obligation to feature product(s) on social platforms) AD Megaphone - Sponsored item (Brand has paid me money and I have signed a contract for the item to appear in the video.

Is La Roche Posay right for your skincare routine. Hey guys and welcome back too Mad About Skin where in todays video we are talking La Roche-Posay and working out whether this super popular French Pharmacy brand is right for your skincare routine. La Rosh-Posay has been growing in popularity from a staple of the French pharmacy skincare offering to a truly global brand which is a skincare favourite of many people. When it comes to La Roche Posay, many people know them for their Cicaplast Baume which is a holy grail for many or for their game changing Antelios sunscreen range - but there is so much more to this brand. In this La Roche-Posay review we will take a look at the things which made this brand so popular but also some of the issue which the brand would rather you were not aware of. I have not mentioned the issues which la Roche Posay have had with the US regulators in terms of some of their marketing claims being questioned as whether their products should be considered medicines rather than skin care. The reason I have left this out is I am not aware enough of the US regulations to make a meaningful discussion on this but it is something to be aware of. I would love to know what your thoughts are on LRP and any of the products you have tried from them so let me know in the comments below. If you enjoyed this video and would like to see more full brand reviews like it then please let me know by giving this one a thumbs up and a like.

Thanks guys for ur comments. It's so nice of you all guys for being with my 1month journey and holding back the patience like me. - Ordered the product on 23rd June - Received on 2nd July \\u0026 started applying since from then. Results:- - Couldn't see any difference on my Skin. - Skin got worse. - Tiggered more new painful acnes. - Smoothness of my skin gone. The product I received is for pigmentation even though I mention to address Acnes concern first and secondly Pigmentation. I m loyale reviewing the product with proof of my before and after pics. SkinKraft has failed for me. No to SkinKraft for my Skin. After the product gets over m not gonna use it again and would like to review new product on my skin. Important information:- - Do let me know on my comment section which product you want me to review next. Or - do you want me to share my home remedies. Note:- - Don't believe the Brand Ambassadors of Skin Kraft reviewers who doesn't show any proof to you and speaking only which doesn't make any sense. Buy a product having proof n u can believe.

Grapefruit has benefits for skin. Grapefruit contains vitamin C, which helps protect the skin against sun damage, aging, and inflammation ( 29 ).

I am not, however, a licensed dermatologist or esthetician, nor do I claim to know more than either. I have checked with multiple dermatologists and estheticians to ensure that my use of the word 'specialist' is appropriate, to which they have confirmed so long as I disclose that I am not a dermatologist or esthetician. After consulting my subscribers as well, I felt that because the term specialist is my career title and is deemed appropriate by licensed professionals, I would prefer to use it instead of the terms 'expert' or 'guru', neither of which apply to me because I consider myself far below 'expert status'.

Specifically, I am reviewing: Vanicream vs. Cerave Cleanser, Vanicream vs. Cerave Moisturizing Lotion and Vanicream vs. Cerave Moisturizing Cream. I have oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin, and have tested all products in this video to offer a fair and honest comparison review. If you have a skin condition, or have extremely sensitive, dry, oily, and/or breakout-prone skin, this video is perfect for you to figure out if Vanicream or Cerave is the best option for you. In general, Vanicream seems to be better than Cerave for people with sensitive skin types. Cerave does have better skin-loving ingredients in their products though, like Niacinimide, Ceramides, and Hyaluronic Acid. Both brands are fragrance free \\u0026 free of many allergens and irritants like dyes, but Vanicream seems to be free from all potential irritants. Sensitive skin care. #vanicream #cerave #ceravevsvanicream #vanicreamgentlefacialcleanser #vanicreamcleanser #vanicreammoisturizinglotion #vanicreamlitelotion #vanicreamlotion #vanicreammoisturizingcream #vanicreammoisturizer #fragrancefree #skincare #sensitiveskin FTC: This video is not in collaboration with any brands.

Tatcha The Rice Wash Skin Softening Cleanser: What it is: A PH-neutral, daily cream cleanser that gently washes away impurities without stripping skin—leaving it hydrated, feeling soft, and looking luminous. Skin Type: Normal, Dry, and Combination Highlighted Ingredients: - Blend of Japanese Algae: Leaves skin feeling soft, comforted, and nourished. - Hyaluronic Acid: Helps skin look smooth and plump with hydration. - Tatcha‘s Signature Hadasei-3: Restores a visibly healthy-, youthful-looking radiance. Ingredient Callouts: This product is vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free. 2. Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream Moisturizer: What it is: A rich cream that feeds skin with plumping hydration and antioxidant-packed Japanese purple rice for a dewy, healthy glow. Skin Type: Normal and Dry Skincare Concerns: Dryness, Dullness and Uneven Texture, and Loss of Firmness and Elasticity Formulation: Rich Cream Highlighted Ingredients: - Japanese Purple Rice: Packed with nutrients and known for its ability to survive any harsh environment, it has long been used to celebrate longevity and vitality; rich in anthocyanin, a strong antioxidant, it helps skin recover from and protect against stress, pollution, and UV damage for healthier-looking skin. - Okinawa Algae Blend and Hyaluronic Acid: Captures water to help replenish skin’s natural moisture reservoir, immediately leaving skin soft, comforted, and deeply nourished; helps to replenish ceramides to ensure optimum skin barrier function, aiding in the reduction of future moisture loss, for skin that is visibly smooth and plump with hydration. - Botanical Extracts: From ginseng, wild thyme, and sweet marjoram; nourishes skin, enhancing its natural ability to retain and release moisture as needed, and imparts a dewy glow. Ingredient Callouts: This product is cruelty-free, and gluten-free. It comes in recyclable packaging. What Else You Need to Know: This cream intensely hydrates and seals in moisture, helping to replenish ceramides for a healthy bounce and instant luminosity. A fermentation of Japanese anti-aging superfoods—green tea, rice, and algae—helps skin to look its most beautiful at any age. 3. Tatcha Luminous Dewy Skin Mist: What it is: A silky, fine mist moisturizer that can be used under or over makeup for dewy glowing skin anytime, anywhere.

A moisturizing cream can help reinforce the skin barrier with hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, or a ceramide cream that replenishes essential skin barrier components. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream acts as both by effectively hydrating as it helps restore the skin’s protective barrier. Developed with dermatologists and ideal for dry and very dry skin on the face and body, this rich, non-greasy, fast-absorbing moisturizing cream features patented MVE Delivery Technology to release a steady stream of hyaluronic acid and three essential ceramides throughout the day and night. Suitable for sensitive skin, this oil-free and fragrance-free ceramide cream also helps the skin hold on to moisture while improving its look and feel. Suitable for dry and very dry skin on the face and body MVE Technology: This patented delivery system continually releases moisturizing ingredients for 24-hour hydration Ceramides: Essential for healthy skin, ceramides help restore and maintain the skin’s natural barrier Hyaluronic acid: This ingredient attracts hydration to the skin’s surface and helps the skin retain moisture Non-comedogenic, oil-free, hypoallergenic, fragrance-free and suitable for sensitive skin Developed with dermatologists Video Overview: This video is review of the Cerave Moisturizing Cream. In this video I talk through the Cerave Moisturizing Cream for: Oily Skin, Acne-Prone Skin, Dry Skin, Sensitive Skin and Combination Skin. I also explain how I healed my Skin Barrier Damage from Essential Oils with the Cerave Moisturizing Cream. I chat about when to use the Cerave Moisturizing Routine in your skincare routine, and also discuss whether or not this product causes burning, stinging, and irritation for my skin. #cerave #ceravereview #ceravemoisturizingcream #ceravemoisturizingcreamreview #ceravemoisturizingcreambarrierdamage #ceravemoisturizingcreamsensitiveskin #moisturizer #moisturizingcream #combinationskin #oilyskin #sensitiveskin #acneproneskin #acne #hormonalacne FTC: This video is not in collaboration with any brands.

One of the main things that people have been saying is that JLO absolute has to have had #plasticsurgery or #invasivetreatments of some sort done in order to have the beautiful, radiant skin and body that she has. It's not uncommon for celebrities of her stature to get these procedures, and in fact it's more common than not that celebrities do get plastic surgery. But we're here to talk about #JenniferLopez and her dedication to her skincare regime and the active ingredient in the majority of the products, olive oil. Throughout the years, JLO has relatively consistently steered the public away from the idea that she has gone under the knife for any reason. There are quite a few videos, articles, and news stories about this and we aren't by any means telling you that she has or hasn't done this, but we are here to talk about the idea that women at her age CAN achieve her look without these procedures. Her skincare regiment is a fairly strict one and she has practiced it for many, many years. The active ingredient in her products is powerfully antiaging and it is one that we have used for decades and fully believe in. Moreover, JLO has access to the best nutritionists, personal trainers, chefs, and makeup artists in the country. While she may not abide by the #nomakeup philosophy that we do, she does have everything going for her to look as good as she does at her age. It is possible and you CAN do it with a little bit of dedication and perseverance. We want to let you know that you too can look as good as JLO does on a daily basis without the cost, trauma, and danger of plastic surgery!

Everything I used this week includes: Soy Face Cleanser, Rose Floral Toner, Vitamin Nectar Glow Juice Antioxidant Face Serum, Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream All linked below! Have any of you used Fresh before? For those of you who have used the Fresh line before, did you notice a difference in your skin? Did you have any favorite products? I would love to hear from you guys about your experience so comment below! I have been really wanting to try Fresh for a while so this was super fun to test out! I definitely have some favorites from the line and other products that I didn’t love as much. So definitely watch to the very end to find out what those pro’s and con’s are! A small disclaimer, I am by no means a dermatologist or a doctor. I am just a self-proclaimed skincare junkie who loves to try and test products so that I can share my experiences with all of you!

We chat about beauty, skincare and lifestyle issues that we start to face after our mid forties. I am 51! This is a channel to help us tackle aging concerns, whether that is skincare, makeup or life issues. I am an R.N. and therefore I am a bit of a science geek and I am passionate about ingredients and which ones actually hold the most promise to help ease the aging process. I am looking to bring you any product or service that can make the second half of life the best half. I take my reviews very seriously. I rarely do first impressions anymore. I like to take time to really test out a product before it gets Mona's stamp of approval. I will never steer you towards a brand/product or steer you away from one without very thorough research and testing. xx Mona 👀 Disclaimer - All products reviewed have been purchased by me. I will let you know if any products are gifted to me. Many product links are affiliate links. That means that I earn a small commission if you use them. This helps support my channel, allowing me to purchase more products for review. I will never steer you towards a brand/product or steer you away from one without very thorough research and testing.

Pero nunca me atrevía Me sentía morir por dentro... Pero nunca me atrevía Y ahora entiendo tus ataques de rabia Y tu eterno silencio... Tu sonrisa y tu tierna mirada Ya desaparecieron... Tu sonrisa y tu tierna mirada Ya desaparecieron... Que tristeza tus extrañas llamadas Sabias que lo peor yo me imaginaba Y no te importaba mi sufrimiento Hoy comprendo por que siempre me hablabas De alguien que te hacia sentir alagada Y mi amor en ti se fue diluyendo Ay, Dios mió quítame esta pena... Ay, Dios mió que me esta matando Ay, yo no entiendo por que me condena... Quiero odiarla y la sigo amando Ay, ay, ay, yo la sigo amando Ay, ay, ay, yo la sigo amando Terco soy, yo la sigo amando Ay, ay, ay, yo la sigo amando Enmarcaste el peor momento... De una vida destrozada Que con el pasar del tiempo... Sigue y sigue ilusionada Que seas feliz todo el tiempo... Que nunca te falte nada... Que yo iré reconstruyendo Me vida despedazada... Como aquel que está muriendo... Y aún conserva la esperanza Como aquel que está muriendo Y aún conserva la esperanza Caprichosa me decías por momento Que tu amor era eterno... Hoy me dejas sin destino sin rumbo Y viviendo un infierno... Hoy me dejas sin destino sin rumbo Y viviendo un infierno... Ojalá y no te sientas engañada Dicen que todo el que la hace, la paga Y eso yo no lo deseo para ti Si un día vuelves sin destino, sin calma No creas que lo voy a hacer por venganza Pero ya no habrá un lugar para ti Ay, Dios mió cúrame esta pena... Ay, Dios mió que me esta matando Ay, yo no entiendo por que me condena...

Timestamps 0:00 Introduction: Best exercise tips 0:56 Exercise time 1:30 Exercise intensity 3:48 Exercise recovery 5:45 Key takeaways In this video, we’re going to talk about how to figure out your perfect exercise. If you’re not sure where to start with your exercise program, these exercise tips are for you. Your exercise program is made up of three variables: • Time (how long you work out) • Intensity (how intense your workout will be) • Frequency/Recovery (how often you workout each week and how much time you give your body to recover between workouts) Each of these will affect how your results look. Here’s why! 1. Workout time Working out for too long may increase your cortisol levels. In turn, this can actually reduce your muscle mass. If you notice that you’re not building muscle, try shortening your workouts. Boosting growth hormone for fat loss doesn’t require long exercise sessions. 20 to 40 minutes of intense exercise is all you need each day. 2. Intensity High-intensity exercise is the best way to lose weight and build muscle. HIIT (high-intensity interval training) is the perfect form of exercise for losing weight and toning your muscles. HIIT exercise typically involves all of your muscles. 3. Frequency/recovery Working out too frequently or not frequently enough can reduce your results. Working out every day or twice every day will lower your recovery and lead to muscle loss and fatigue. It can even cause you to gain weight if your cortisol levels are increasing. Doing a single 20 to 40-minute high-intensity interval training workout every other day or every third day is the perfect workout for most people. Give these tips a try, and let me know how they work for you in the comments below.

By taking these steps you'll be impressed with your improved recovery rate and strength levels. Find out exactly how things like cold showers, supplementation post-workout, and foam-rolling can all improve your workout experience. Also learn the best foods to eat after a workout to maximize recovery, strength, and size gains. 🔥 FREE 6 Week Shred: http://bit.ly/2Bv8CL4 📲 FREE Diet/Workout Planner Tool: http://bit.ly/2N41lTX Whether you want to burn fat or build muscle, your workout is just one piece of the puzzle. You'll definitely want to do certain things after your workout to maximize recovery and speed up your progress. And this can range from eating certain foods and taking specific supplements all the way to manipulating your body temperature in order to boost recovery and strength. So I'm going to go over all that today starting first with one of my favorite things to do after any workout and that's contrast therapy. Essentially you would expose a limb or your entire body to a hot temperature for a period of time, and then you would immediately expose it to a very cold temperature for a period of time... and you would repeat this process several times. In very interesting study researchers compared contrast therapy to things like cold water immersion, hot water immersion, passive recovery, stretching, and active recovery (13). Keep in mind all of these things are believed to be helpful with reducing soreness and speeding up recovery. But researchers found that contrast therapy led to greater improvements in the areas of muscle soreness and post-recovery strength levels than every other recovery method. It also reduced muscle inflammation, improved mobility, and muscle range of motion significantly. This means that contrast therapy can help you recover from workouts faster than almost any other method. Now the easiest way to perform contrast therapy that anyone can do starting today is by switching between a very cold and hot shower. You can switch back and forth, doing a minute of each for a total of ten minutes. However, my personal favorite way to do this is by using a sauna in combination with an ice plunge. You would get your body really warmed up in a sauna by staying in there for at least a few minutes and then once you're really warmed up you would jump into the ice plunge, which is basically freezing cold water. Now if you don't have access to an ice plunge you can do something similar by using the sauna at your gym and then immediately taking a cold shower for at least a minute and then doing that back and forth for a few rounds. If on the other hand, you do want to try an ice plunge you can find one in most traditional Russian and Korean bathhouses. The next thing you'll want to do after a workout is instead of having a sports drink like vitamin water, drink some Tart Cherry Juice because it's specifically great at reducing post-workout muscle soreness. Multiple studies show that consuming tart cherry after resistance training reduces muscle protein breakdown and muscle soreness while speeding up the rate of recovery. (1) One of these studies was specifically focused on eccentric exercise. For those of you that don't know the eccentric portion of an exercise is when you extend and elongate the muscle as opposed to the concentric portion which is when you contract and shorten the muscle. So for example with exercises like bench press, bicep curls, and squats the eccentric portion would be when you're lowering the weight down. Although both concentric and eccentric ranges of motion will break down muscle tissue, the eccentric portion is believed to do the most muscle damage in the form of microscopic tears. So this study was especially interesting because it aimed to find out if tart cherry consumption before and after eccentric exercise would have a protective effect on muscle damage symptoms. (2) So they set up the experiment by having college students either drink twelve ounces of a tart cherry juice blend or a placebo twice a day, once in the morning and once at night for eight days straight. And the scientists found that the group taking the placebo still had a strength loss of 30% even 24 hours after finished the eccentric exercise. And after 96 hours they still had a 12% reduction in strength in the muscles targeted with the eccentric exercise. On the other hand, the group taking the tart cherry juice instead of the placebo only experienced a 12% strength loss after 24 hours and after 96 hours they actually had a 6 percent strength boost above baseline. So in other words, the tart cherry juice reduced strength losses after their workout and helped them recover faster. The reason that tart cherries provide these benefits is that they contain special flavonoids and anthocyanins, which are a group of substances that have antioxidant effects on the body...","tags":"Best Things to do After the Gym, Things You Should Do After the Gym, best post workout meal, what to eat after a workout, what to do to decrease muscle soreness, how to speed up recovery after a workout, how to relieve muscle soreness, cold shower, cold showers after a workout, best food to eat after a workout, Things that happen when you take a cold shower, foam rolling for muscle soreness, supplements for recovery, best supplements after a workout, best post workout recovery","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nrQ1CQ2HRYk/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-EM9yyjaIo","title":"Exercise Tips for Seniors","description":"Kathy Shillue of Rehabilitation Services at BIDMC explains some easy exercises you can do to maintain balance and stay active.","tags":"balance, bidmc, boston, exercise, senior health","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r-EM9yyjaIo/hqdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z7c7NdcH7I","title":"How to Exercise &amp; Diet Correctly for Your Body Type | Joanna Soh","description":"Download My Fitness App \\u0026 Get 25% Off All FIO Premium Plans: https://www.fiolife.com/go-premium/FIOWITHJO SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/SUBJoannaSoh | Follow my IG: https://instagram.com/joannasohofficial/ Weight Loss Tips: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyP8pbBMxcsjSQjf_2V8ZJku_njMfh_Zm Weight Loss Meal Plan \\u0026 Recipes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyP8pbBMxcsiVZKn2idlOzVppEmkQuXBp Abs \\u0026 Core Workout: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyP8pbBMxcsi0MwwHzR5tWUjphLt7vt5q Crazy Workout Challenges: https://youtube.com/watch?v=g83v1m2P4_g\\u0026list=PLyP8pbBMxcsgw079OkBK0o-sjKzX4qE0Jm How to Exercise \\u0026 Diet Correctly for Your Body Type | Joanna Soh Do you know what's your body type?

Timestamps: 0:25 Myth #1: You have to replenish your glycogen reserve. 2:04 Myth #2: You need to eat protein after a workout to build muscle. 3:05 Why you should avoid insulin 3:44 Tips for getting the most out of workouts In this video, we’re going to talk about the pre and post-workout meal myth. Many people will tell you that you need to consume a meal before or after a workout to replenish glycogen stores and build muscle mass. Let’s talk about each of these. Myth #1: You have to replenish your glycogen reserve. You have a certain storage of sugar in your muscles and liver. After about a half hour of working out, you become tapped out of glycogen. After the glycogen stores are depleted, then you start burning fat. If your goal is to lose weight or get toned, then you want to deplete your glycogen stores. Replenishing them doesn’t make sense. Additionally, every time you consume high-protein foods, like a protein bar or protein shake, it triggers insulin. Insulin stops the natural fat burning process. Myth #2: You need to eat protein after a workout to build muscle. Anything you eat right before or after a workout will not immediately affect your muscle mass. It takes at least 24 hours for your digestive tract to break down protein into usable nutrients. The idea that a protein shake is immediately going to your muscles doesn’t add up. You don’t really need protein around your workouts to build muscle mass. It’s the meal you ate yesterday that creates muscle today—keep that in mind. Additionally, if you consume too much protein, you will overload your liver, and it won’t end up as muscle. What you really need to do is avoid things that spike your insulin levels around your workouts—this includes protein shakes and protein bars. You should also know that insulin nullifies growth hormone. When you work out, you induce a stress event that breaks down muscles. During the recovery process is when your body builds muscle. Growth hormone is instrumental—which means that spiking insulin is a huge problem. Tips for getting the most out of your workout: • Get good sleep • Don’t eat anything before, during, or after your workout • Avoid insulin-spiking foods Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis \\u0026 Intermittent Fasting.

This is a joint video on the three muscle-building myths. Myth #1: We Need Carbs to Build Muscle This is true to some degree, however, too much insulin causes a condition called insulin resistance, which then causes the body not to be able to absorb insulin anymore. This is a situation in the body where there is both excess insulin in certain places and insufficient insulin in other places. And carbs do trigger insulin but the question is how much glucose (concentrated carbs) do we really need in our blood to maintain normal. Well, it's only a very small amount. If you look at normal blood sugar (80-90 mg/dl), we only need around 1 teaspoon of sugar per our entire body's blood. But an average person consumes 27-31 tsp of sugar per day. Thomas Delauer explains his history of consuming carbs all the time and how it influenced his body weight. With all the carbs and all the insulin, the body adapts and creates insulin resistance, which makes insulin unavailable and forces the body to make more insulin. Ketosis actually preserves glucose in the muscle and this protects your muscles. The best way to preserve muscle is to keep your fat content high (but keep your carbs low). Myth #2 We Need Lots of Protein to Build Muscle Makes sense since our muscles are made of protein, however, excess dietary protein triggers insulin and can limit your body to absorb protein. When you do ketosis and intermittent fasting you can increase Growth Hormone which preserves your muscles. On average our body needs 3-6 ounces of protein with each meal. Thomas DeLauer recommends we need 0.50-0.70 grams of protein per lb of body weight. He explains that too much protein can also negatively effect your kidneys. To build muscle, we only need \\","tags":"thomas delauer, thomas delauer and dr. berg, thomas delauer interview, thomas delauer keto, gain muscle mass, build muscle, muscle growth, keto and fitness, fitness, muscle building, dr eric berg and thomas delauer, dr berg interview, muscle growth workout, muscle growth explained, muscle growth diet, build muscle on keto, gain muscle mass on keto diet, gain muscle mass diet, health and fitness, growth hormone, muscle building myths, muscles, dr berg, eric berg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fYCevT0dBac/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXiGOHamI5Y","title":"Mayo Clinic Minute: 6 tips to keep you motivated for exercise","description":"Exercise is good for your health.

Exercise is very important to stay active. But it does not have to be only at gym class. It can be something fun too. Playing is not just fun but also keeps you physically active. Benefits of Exercise - There are a lot of benefits from regular exercise. Kids who are active will: - have stronger muscles and bones - be less likely to become overweight - decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes - lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels - have a better outlook on life Besides enjoying the health benefits of regular exercise, kids who are physically fit sleep better. They're also better able to handle physical and emotional challenges — from running to catch a bus to studying for a test. The Three Elements of Fitness - The three elements of fitness in action when kids play in the playground are: 1. Endurance: When a child is chasing or being chased by another child at play. 2. Strength: When a child crosses a monkey bar. 3. Flexibility: Bending down to tie their shoes. Regular aerobic activity helps a child to build good endurance levels. Aerobic exercise causes the heart to beat faster and a person breathes harder. Regular aerobic activity strengthens the heart and improves the body's ability to deliver oxygen to all its cells. Following are some fun aerobic activities: - basketball - bicycling - ice skating - soccer - swimming - tennis - walking - jogging - running Improving strength doesn't have to be only from only lifting weights instead, kids can do push-ups, stomach crunches, pull-ups, and other exercises to help tone and strengthen muscles. They also improve their strength when they climb, do a handstand, or wrestle. Stretching exercises helps a child improve flexibility, allowing muscles and joints to bend and move easily through their full range of motion. Simplest activities like reaching out for a toy or practicing a split or doing a cartwheel are fun ways to stretch and build one’s flexibility. #ExerciseRegularly #HealthTips #AskColey To learn more about how regular exercise keeps you healthy, visit the best e-learning website here: https://mocomi.com/exercise-regularly/ For more fun learning health tips and good habits, visit: https://mocomi.com/learn/new-world/ask-coley/ Watch more ask coley videos in one go here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrIPt0fi9vk\\u0026list=PL6vCwGtCTVtOEYlvjEu5c3SCN99aP12bh Subscribe here for new and interesting content every week ► ► https://www.youtube.com/mocomikids?sub_confirmation=1 Press Bell Icon 🔔; For Latest Updates.

How to overcome it: - eat less sugar and alcohol - more protein and 'healthy fats' (nuts, oily fish) - walking and following exercises: lunges, squats, push-ups. The STRESS BELLY caused by constant stress, missing meals, an irritable bowel, an unhealthy diet. How to overcome it: - go to bed earlier - add magnesium to your diet - to calm down: yoga, stretching, camomile tea. The LOW BELLY caused by recent child birth, a monotonous diet, a curved spine. How to overcome it: - healthy eating: more fiber, carbohydrates, vegetables and water - 'plank' exercises - ciurcuit training. The MOM BELLY caused by a weak pelvic floor. How to overcome it: - more 'healthy' fats - Kegel exercises - stretching - keep the belly drawn inwards - daytime naps A BLOATED BELLY IN THE EVENING caused by food allergies, a weak bowel. How to overcome it: - don't eat starchy food, alcohol, dairy products - more vegetables, chicken, fish, water - a full breakfast - breathing exercise: inhale and exhale deeply 10 times while lying on your back - take walks after eating.

Knowing the right ACL exercises and rehab tips can really help you to speed up your recovery. In this video, I'll show you how the anterior cruciate ligament functions and what causes it to fail in the first place. When you know the function of the ligament you can get a better appreciation for what you need to do to strengthen the knee before it happens. With almost 70 percent of the ACL tears happening in non contact situations, learning how to control your body and strengthen your knees using exercises that keep your feet on the ground is key. Since you likely injured your ACL in standing, running or cutting, we need to get you off the open chain exercises and to start using closed chain exercises. My favorite exercise for ACL rehab is a front squat. You don't have to load up the weight at all at the start. You will gradually build up your strength over time. The fact that this exercise helps to put your center of gravity a bit in front of your body helps to take some of the strain off the ligament that you would get from leg extensions. To completely fortify your body against injuries like ACL tears, you need to train like an athlete. You can build ripped athletic muscle, six pack abs, and a strong functional body...if you train the right way. Let pro athlete physical therapist Jeff Cavaliere show you exactly how with his ATHLEAN-X Training System used by today's top pros. You can find it at http://athleanx.com right now.

In this video, I’m going to go over the biggest beginner workout mistakes that people make that undercut their ability to see the best results that they can get in the long run. I will cover everything from the importance of the bench press, squat and deadlift while remembering not to rely solely on them or attempt to lift too much weight at the expense of good form. To start, full range of motion on exercises is incredibly important for anyone lifting weights. This holds true whether you are a beginner or even more advanced. The use of full range of motion helps to strengthen the kinetic chain while improving coordination. Many beginners lack joint coordination or awareness in space and instead will use shortened range of motions in order to trick themselves into thinking they are doing more than they are. The compound lifts are key exercises for promoting the opportunity for full range of motion. Because they utilize multiple muscle groups and joints they allow you to load up the highest amounts of weights that you can on any exercise. That tends to create some fear of these exercises for beginners however. The sense of danger on these exercises is certainly higher than on a concentration curl but that doesn’t mean they should be avoided. Instead, using weight that you can command and building a true strength base on top of that is the answer. If you start using weights that you can handle and continue to increase your strength on these lifts over time, you won’t fear the movement. As you see results come from performing these exercises you will become less self conscious of those around you and your fears of using weights that you feel are too light in comparison to what others are using. Remember, we all start somewhere. Even the strongest guy in the gym started out using the bar. Keep adding weights only when you can perform the lift in good form. Too many so called experts think that it is a badge of honor to have a “strong” lift when it is nothing more than an average lift wrapped around a whole lot of bad form and compensation. Do not copy this. You may even wind up looking as bad as they do if you follow that advice. From here you want to make sure that you do not approach your training and workout sessions lazily. What this means is that instead of just grabbing a bar, squeeze it for all its worth. The strength that is elicited by simply doing that will surprise you. Do not just move the bar from point A to point B, execute the movement and exercise with your highest intensity. You will need a great deal of grip strength as a beginner to take advantage of this but you can build that by not avoiding forearm work and remembering to rack all of your own dumbbells and plates. If you are looking for a workout program for beginners that will help you to build muscle fast, head to http://athleanx.com and get the ATHLEAN-X Training System. Start training like an athlete and building a solid foundation of muscle, strength and athleticism and you will be amazed at how much faster you see results long term.

Breath hold is one of the most important skills in spearfishing. However, it’s not a skill that you can learn overnight and it requires constant training. If you want to increase your breath hold time in the water, here’s how you can improve your breath hold: Breath Hold Exercise In this exercise, you’re going to do three breath holds. First, just hold your breath until you feel like breathing. In the second exercise, you’re going to hold your breath until you feel decidedly uncomfortable. If you haven't had any contractions in your second one, just go with your third breath until you get a contraction, and to feel decidedly uncomfortable. And then start breathing again. For the third one, keep holding your breath and just check out when the contractions come in. Here’s a detailed overview of breath holding. Determine your base time It’s important to time your breath holds. Use a stopwatch to get your starting point and time yourself as you hold your breath. You can use the data later in determining your base time. To calculate your base time, you’ll just have to get the average time of your three breath hold exercises. The numbers aren't important. They're not important as to your status as a diver, or your ability as a diver. They only serve as a starting point to begin to change. You might start with a short breath hold time today and then just keep on slowly building it up. This is what we use our time for and not for comparing with someone else because as you train, it all evens out in the end. Some people start with a great breath hold that amazes everyone. While some people doggedly start and struggle to hold their breath for 30 seconds. They just keep working at it and it all works out in the end—they all start coming about the same level. Except for the person who's had the hard work to do, he will value it a bit more. Practice regularly Nothing beats constant practice. Practice breath holding regularly. You can give a couple of minutes each morning to work on your breathing. If you're not in the pool training, at least you can be home watching TV and do a series of three or four breath holds. The next important thing is having a look at what's happening in your body. You may find breath holding a bit difficult at the start, but remember that it’s just one step of all the things that will come about to bring a better diver. It's training one thing up at a time. Take the time to find the things that you need to improve on. Identify your weak points and make them your strength—and you can only do this by training everyday.

I’m calling this one the ab workout “master tip” for good reason. In this video, you will see how you can instantly fix one thing about every abs exercise you do that will increase the results you see from doing the exercises and your chances of getting a visible six pack. It starts with a quick test. Lie on your side and perform a side crunch. Make sure that you are not pulling on your neck when you do this abs and obliques exercise. After cranking out ten or so reps, look down at your body and see if you might be doing what I’m about to point out. Are you ever actually releasing the reps and letting your body elongate fully or are you crunching repeatedly from a half rep or shortened range of motion? Likely, you are not ever going through a full concentric and eccentric contraction. You are instead, isometrically contracting your abs and obliques and just half repping your side crunches for the entire set. Now, it’s important to understand that while you are always going to be stronger in the isometric contraction of a muscle group than the concentric, that doesn’t mean that you want to train that way. Here, the isometric hold is just giving your abs a chance to be let off the hook while the rest of your body does the majority of the moving. This is not ideal if you want to fully develop a muscle. Instead, the master tip for ab workouts requires that you take each and every ab exercise repetition through its full range of motion. It sounds like a simple concept until you start to apply it to other ab exercises and realize just how much you have not been doing this. If you ever struggle to feel the contraction in the abs, obliques or serratus when you are doing a core exercise this is likely your problem. If you stay in a contracted state you will never feel the excursion of a full rep as you take it through the concentric and eccentric contractions. To fix this, start becoming aware of the elongation of the rectus abdominis or obliques during your ab exercises. Don’t just get into a semi-shortened muscle contraction and crank away with all kinds of movement occurring in ever area of your body but your abs. Instead, let the abs themselves do all of the work. You might find that this drastically limits the number of reps that you can do in your ab workouts and that is fine. Over time, it is going to be the accumulation of quality reps that is going to give you the results that you are seeking and the six pack abs that you’ve been wanting. This can be applied to every single abs exercise you do, which again is why this is called the master tip. While performing a hanging abs exercise for example, you want to fully extend your body and let the abs undergo a stretch. Think of it as trying to elongate your entire spine. From here, crunch with the abs and curl your pelvis up until your butt is showing in front of you. This is a quality ab contraction and exactly what you should strive for on every rep.

I’m calling this one the back workout “master tip” for good reason. In this video, you will see how you can instantly fix one thing about every back exercise you do that will increase the results you see from doing the exercises. It starts with an understanding of what we are trying to accomplish when we train our back muscles. The lats are located on the back side of our body and in order to fully contract them, we need to get the arms (where the lats are attached to) behind our body closer to the origin of the lat muscle on our spine. This means that we need to get our elbows behind our body and our arms into extension. When you think about the easiest way to do that you quickly realize that if you can get your spine into extension (mostly your thoracic spine) then you can get your arms back a lot easier. In order to do this, there is something we can do without even touching a weight that is going to allow us to feel what it should feel like when we get it right. I call this the superman move. Place your hands on your chest and pretend that you are ripping open your t-shirt to reveal the big “S” on your chest like Superman. Notice, in order to do this right, you don’t just pull your elbows out to the sides but you pull them back and behind you at the same time. Beyond that, you also need to actively push your chest (sternum) forward as you do this to make this even easier. This same movement can be translated over to every single exercise you do in your back workouts and help you to get more out of them in the process. Starting with a lat pulldown is probably the easiest. Notice in the video that you aren’t just trying to get your elbows down and behind you. That won’t be enough. In order to get the lats maximally contracted you need to push your chest out as your pull your elbows back. You will instantly feel the intensity of the lat contraction go up when you do this right. The same can be said about a pullup as well. Don’t just let pull down with the elbows (as you have likely been told by many experts) but pull down and back with the elbows at the same time that you are pushing your chest bone forward. If anything, you should feel as if you are at least not letting your chest bone cave in when doing the movement. Rows are even easier to get this movement down right. As you pull the bar or dumbbell up to you, be sure to actively and consciously push your chest away from you. The two points should be moving in equal and opposite directions. This is not necessarily a leverage move since you don’t have anything to post your chest on to gain a mechanical advantage. This is simply a biomechanics move that allows your back to get into thoracic extension which makes the extension of the arm behind the body even easier and ensures a peak lat contraction (maybe for even the very first time if you have not been doing this all along). Finally, even a straight arm pushdown can be done with this technique. As your arms are traveling down towards your sides and slightly behind your body, be sure to stick your chest out. Using ropes here will allow you to get the arms behind the body even more than a straight bar would.

Shoulder Injury Prevention Tips.","description":"Did you know that over 7 million patients a year visit their primary care physician or an urgent care with shoulder pain? 7… million! And, 4 million of those 7 are diagnosed with a rotator cuff injury. Crazy, right? How ‘bout this stat… if you’re over the age of 50, you have a 1 in 4 chance of messing up your shoulder at some point. These injuries can come from athletics, from your workouts, and even (and often) from every day activities like painting a ceiling, typing, or moving a grill! You might not be surprised to learn that most often these injuries stem from repetitive motion, like throwing a ball, doing high rep bicep curls a lot, or… texting! That means every one of you is at risk here. Now that I have your attention, I think it’s clear we need to talk about how to not become a statistic. And, if you do fall into those 7 million, or if you don’t want to, Studio SWEAT onDemand founder, Cat Kom, and Dr. Ben DeLuca are gonna help you. Yep, in this video Cat and Ben discuss shoulder injury prevention, awesome ways to assess shoulder pain, the best modifications based on your shoulder injury, how to properly warm up the shoulder, good shoulder stretches to consider, and more! Anatomy 101, head, shoulders, knees and toes… knees and toes. Shoulder pain is directly related to many parts of our anatomy. You may go into the doctor’s office with a neck pain complaint, which very well can lead to identifying that a shoulder injury is the culprit. On the flip side, you might go in with back pain, only to learn it’s a torn rotator cuff. And, you might have gotten a shoulder impingement from too many bicep curls. That is called collateral damage my friends. This is why it’s important to first assess where the root cause of your pain is coming from. Once you identify where the pain is coming from and what movement you’re doing to cause said pain, you can be diagnosed and head down the path of shoulder rehabilitation. In general, there are two main types of shoulder related injuries: Bicep Tendonitis and Rotator Cuff injuries. Bicep Tendonitis is inflammation and irritation of the biceps tendon, which runs along the inside of your upper arm and connects your bicep muscle with bones in the shoulder. This type of injury would often cause pain in the front of the shoulder, and you might feel this pain primarily in push activities, such as a push-up. Rotator Cuff injuries can involve any or all of the 4 rotator cuff muscles. With this type of injury, you could experience pain in the upper arm, back, and even your chest. You might feel this pain when doing side or lateral movements, front raises, overhead presses, and more. You might even feel this pain doing something as simple as combing your hair! So, step 1… Dr. Ben suggests you either go to a professional or try to assess your own pain by moving through a series of shoulder rotations and arm raises, trying to feel which ones cause any sort of sharp pain, tightness, or limited ROM. Once you know which rotations or motions trigger “bad” pain, it’s important to know what to do next. One of the first things Cat and Dr. DeLuca both strongly recommend after you figure out which rotations and movements hurt is that you keep moving. Keeping your circulatory system going promotes positive blood flow to all areas of the body and is a very important step towards healing any injury. Going through a comfortable and even slightly challenging ROM with an injured joint is important in keeping the muscles moving as not to let the area atrophy (muscle weakening). Of course, if your injury happened due to trauma or is a medical surgery situation, obviously that is a different story and a medical professional should be consulted. Beyond keeping moving, in order to prevent and/or heal shoulder injuries, there are 5 things trainer Cat and Dr. Ben say are key. Always warm-up your upper body (namely the shoulders) before any workout, whether it be in the gym or the garden. Incorporate more pull exercises and activities into your daily workout or routine. Stretch your upper body. If it hurts, don’t do it. Just because your shoulder hurts, it’s not an excuse to not workout! Identify the pain and then work around it until it’s better. So, check out this awesome vlogcast to see expert trainer Cat and Dr. Ben DeLuca demonstrate some great shoulder warm-ups, exercises, and stretches to help you figure out how you can keep your shoulders strong and healthy for a lifetime!

Some common machines at the gym can be really bad for your joints and lower back. Avoid these common gym mistakes so that you don't get an injury while exercising. 🔥 FREE 6 Week Shred: http://bit.ly/2Bv8CL4 📲 FREE Diet/Workout Planner Tool: http://bit.ly/2N41lTX Certain gym machines can put you in position that can do more harm than good especially if they're done incorrectly and unfortunately many of these exercises are very common. Most people assume that any machine that's put into a gym is safe and effective to use. But that's not the case. Having many different machines in a gym may be helpful for selling gym memberships, but basic dumbbells and barbells are typically more effective than the majority of the complex machines that you see at the gym. so today I WANT zoom in and focus on 8 machines that you're better off replacing or at least changing how you use them. Starting first with the very popular smith machine. Now the smith machine can actually be effective if you perform certain exercises that can only be done on the smith machine. However most people use the smith machine as an alternative to exercises like squats , deadlifts, and bench press which were all intended to be done with a regular barbell. Many people performing these exercises on the smith machine are under the impression that it'll decrease their risk of injury, but this couldn't be further from the truth. The issue is that the smith machine is locked into a set range of motion and has a set barbell path. This means that when you're bench pressing for example, the barbell is forced to go up and down in a fixed straight line. This is bad for your shoulders and it increase the chances that you flare your elbows as you lower the bar down. In a regular bench press your path would almost be an arch like motion from lock out down to the chest. Looking at squats we see a similar issue. Since the bar is locked into a set range of motion squatting on a smith machine isn't biomechanically natural. This is why most people end up squating, by leaning back against the bar. Not only does this take away huge benefits for your core, glutes, and hamstrings, but if you were to lean back like that using a regular barbell you would fall straight back. On top of the bad positions that your joints are going to be in, you're not going to be working your stabilizor muscles since the bar is locked and already stabilized for you. In fact stabilizor muscle activation is about 43 percent lower on a Smith machine compared to regular barbell squats. This can create lazy lifting technique and will only provide a small fraction of the results that you can get from doing these exercises with barbells and dumbbells especially in regard to functional strength. Another machine that you want to stay away from is the hip abduction and the adduction machine. These machines are typically used to train the glutes and inner thighs, but there are far better alternatives that are far more effective like squats and lunges. Both of these machines require heavy loads to be challenging. One immediate issue is that naturally your body would never lift heavy loads this way in real life. The only time these muscles would be engaged at a higher level would be when you're doing single leg activities like walking lunges, and they would mostly just be used for stabilization. Instead as you get stronger at the hip abduction machine you're going to target a muscle know as the tfl or the tensor fasciae latae. This muscle can easily get over worked and tight which will pull on another muscle known as the it band and that quite often leads to knee pain. The heavy weight loads used on both the adductor and the abductor machines can also easily lead to a lower back injury. I've personally seen this time and time again and advising clients to stop using these machines, usually helped improve their lower back pain. The last thing that I'll say is that these machines do not and will not help you reduce fat from your inner and outer thighs. For most of you this may be common sense, but many people using these machines are under the impression that they will slim their thighs by simply opening and closing their legs with resistance. Next is one that many of you won't like t leg press machine. Keep in mind if it works for you, you can continue using it, but this machine, as popular as it is, is responsible for a good amount of lower back injuries. And sure it's easy to blame the person doing the exercise, but there are certain components of this exercise that make a back injury more likely, which is why I suggest you replace the leg press with something like squats, lunges, bulgarians, step ups, and the list can go on and on. When doing leg presses your back is pinned against a pad in a way where it becomes very difficult to maintain the natural lumbar curve as your knees bend and the weight comes down.

These 7 simple pieces will give you everything you need for a complete fat burning, muscle building body transformation. So, if you’re tired of the over-crowded gym scene, or simply want the freedom and flexibility of training in the comfort of your own home, follow along and find out exactly what you need to transform your physique at home! This is the 7 Must Have Essentials For Your Home or Garage Gym! Let’s get to it! #1: Squat Rack With a Pull Up Bar First up, you need a squat rack in your home gym with a pull up bar. This way you can perform the big compound movements like squats, rack pulls, and bench presses safely and get the multi-purpose benefit without needing a separate setup for pull ups and chin ups. Make sure you invest in a strong, quality-built rack for this piece, like ours here from Rogue. When you’re loading up hundreds of pounds on a bar and relying on J clips or safety arms to save your neck in a heavy lift - literally - it’s not something you want to cheap out on. The internet is already full of fitness fail videos with J clips snapping, and equipment breaking, don’t be the face of one! Spend a bit of money and invest in quality. It will last far better and you’ll thank yourself for it in the long run. #2: Adjustable Bench The next thing you’ll want to go along with your squat rack is a quality adjustable bench that can be set at least from flat up to 45 degrees incline. #3 Barbell \\u0026 Bumper Plates The next thing you’ll need to invest in is a quality power bar and some bumper plates. Again, you should be sure to spend your money on a good bar here. You’re going to be loading hundreds of pounds on this thing and putting it through quite a beating over the years to come. You don’t have to break the bank, but you do need to think about your safety and longevity and make a smart decision. If you’re deadlifting 500lbs for reps, don’t get a bar that’s only rated for 450lbs. Step it up and get a real bar that isn’t going to come anywhere close to bending or cracking. Rogue and Eleiko are highly reputable brands that have some great, affordable bars, that will hold up and last for years of use. As for the plates, you don’t need anything fancy, the only thing you need to worry about is the weight. So as long as the plates aren’t missing chunks out of them, they should do the trick. #4 Dumbbells Dumbbells are one of the most versatile pieces of training equipment you can have as they allow you to perform both unilateral and bilateral movements and offer the greatest range of motion and versatility. Most guys will do great with a set of dumbbells from 10-90lbs or so and can upgrade once your strength improves beyond that. The key is to make sure you have enough variety in weights to perform all types of isolation and compound exercises. #5 Kettlebells The unique design of the kettlebell with a thicker handle and off-centered weight distribution can provide some unique benefits in strength training, posterior chain development, grip strength, and coordination. Start with what you need for now and like everything else, expand as necessary while you progress with your training. #6 Medicine Balls You can get away without these guys if you’re trying to be as budget conscious as possible, but these can be especially great for ab workouts and metabolic conditioning training. There’s no other exercise quite like the med ball slam for head to toe power, explosive core strength development and torching excess body fat. #7 Skipping Rope / High Intensity Cardio Piece Finally we have our cardio equipment for last. The key with this is to forget about the old treadmill and elliptical, and instead opt for a high intensity cardio piece so you can get in quick, ultra-effective sessions in, not waste time watching the Home channel as you walk on a hamster wheel. A good ol fashioned skipping rope is the best place to start - if it’s good enough for pro boxers, it’s good enough for us! If you want to get a little fancier and step up the cardio game a little more, a ski erg or air assault bike are our two top choices. All-in, with the high quality rack, barbell, plates, free weights and cardio piece you could ring in your brand new gym to last you the next decade or two for as little as $2000-$3000 or take it far beyond, depending on how far you want to expand. Either way, it will be a worthwhile investment as long as you choose to use it! And that’s the 7 Must Have Essentials For Your Home or Garage Gym!

This is somewhat of a controversial product among home gym owners. It's different. There's not plates or stacks. It uses technology instead of steel. It doesn't feel intimidating, it feels inviting. However, after using Tonal for over 6 months, I'm a believer that this type of home gym is the future for most people. As much as I like barbells, I love Tonal. It's so simple, easy to use, and effective. I don't plan on selling my barbells, but I do plan on using Tonal a lot. ▬ FULL IN-DEPTH WRITTEN REVIEW ▬ https://garagegymreviews.com/tonal-smart-home-gym-review\\r 🔔 Subscribe to my YouTube channel - https://garagegymreviews.co/YouTubeSubscribe All of My Recommendations ↓↓↓↓ ➡ Best Barbells: https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-olympic-barbell ➡ Best Squat Racks: https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-squat-racks​ ➡ Best Benches: https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-weight-benches-guide ➡ Best Bumper Plates: https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-bumper-plates-guide ➡ Best Barbell Collars: https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-olympic-barbell-collars-guide ➡ Best Weight Belts: https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-weightlifting-belts-guide 🏃🏻‍♂️ FOLLOW ME: ►INSTAGRAM: http://garagegymreviews.co/Instagram ►FACEBOOK: http://garagegymreviews.co/Facebook ►TWITTER: http://garagegymreviews.co/Twitter 🔥 JOIN THE COMMUNITY: ►HOME GYM COMMUNITY: http://garagegymreviews.co/Community 👨🏻‍💻 EVERY REVIEW: ►GGR: https://garagegymreviews.com​ We maintain an affiliate relationship with some of the products reviewed, which means we get a percentage of a sale if you click over from our site (at no cost to our readers).

Then get the Best Home Workout here http://athleanx.com/x/workoutathome More and more, guys are turning to their own home gyms as their place to do all of their workouts. The biggest question however is, what is the best home gym equipment for me in order to get in a great workout at home? In this video I cover the 4 essential home gym equipment pieces and provide you with options depending on your budget. In fact, you can turn any home gym into the ultimate home gym if you have the right exercise equipment. It is important to note, that even the best home gym ideas can be impossible if either your space or budget doesn't allow for them! Would I love to have an indoor turf field to sprint on year round? Sure, but I don't have the room! Would I like to have an Olympic swimming pool? Yep but probably not the first item on my budget! So, when I make my recommendations of my 4 favorite pieces of home gym equipment I do so with options to make sure that whatever your budget is, you can make a smart decision. Heck, I even tell you about our bodyweight only workout ATHLEAN XERO which literally can be done without even a single dumbbell or other piece of home gym equipment. You can find that at http://athleanx.com/xero if you want to see more details about it. Meantime, the recommendations in order are... 1. Utility Bench - You'll see that I picked mine up 20 years ago (and still use it today). You can probably find one of these benches in a tag sale for free, with the owner simply glad to get rid of it! 2. Doorway Pullup Bar - These range from 10 to 30 dollars depending on the brand. Just get a sturdy one that won't rip apart your door frame! 3. Resistance Band - Any sturdy well made resistance band will do. Get one with the handles on it if you find it easier to grip. 4. Dumbbells (preferably adjustable dumbbells) - Adjustable dumbbells give you the ultimate in home workout freedom. They allow for progressive overload while providing the best in home dumbbell workouts with the right home dumbbell exercises. If your budget is tight, simply head to Walmart and get two or three pairs that are far enough apart to accommodate your varied strength levels on different exercises. If you have a higher budget and are looking for the ultimate home workout tool then you definitely must check out the new ATHLEAN BLOX at http://athleanx.com/athleanx-blox Dumbbells that you can fit in any home and adjust from 5 to 95 lbs in just seconds at a fraction of the cost of regular dumbbells.

We're talking speed days, recovery times, max effort rep schemes, everything you need to become the best you possible! There are also swag discounts and equipment discounts on the PATREON! We're starting a movement and we'd love for you to join! https://www.patreon.com/wenningstrength STAN EFFERDING - MATT WENNING ON DEMAND SERIES HERE: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/wenningandefferding So you want to invest in yourself this season but don't have the money to buy the top of the line gear, well you don't need expensive gym equipment when you can get these great tools for your gym at a fraction of the cost! Many people think getting the most expensive set of barbells means they're going to get stronger, well that's just not the case. If you have your average at home set or even a set you picked up from a family friend or even a thrift store you can make them even better by using fat grips. They change the mode and push your body to hold the weight differently so your forearms get stronger! Don't sleep on what these grips can do for you and be sure to incorporate tempos, chaotic implements, and timed sets to grow your fitness level! Now, most people who want to get stronger think they need to get a super nice bench for yourself at home. While there is a case for getting a nice bench that has pegs for bands or possibly pins so you are protected you can't lockout on that last set if you buy a set of nice bands for yourself you can change your average bench press into an elite fitness machine for anyone at any level of fitness. Using bands that Elite FTS makes will allow you to change the mode once again whether you're using the lightened method or using them to focus on your lockout, they will take your bench to the next level. How about a rowing machine? They can be thousands and thousands of dollars to grab yourself a mid-level one. We have a solution that will get you doing rows, tricep raises, and more arm exercises without spending major $$$ and that's by using a sled and a long walkway. Just put the weight you normally would on the sled for a row or exercise of your choice and then you can use the sled to target the specific areas for cheap! Lastly, bamboo bars are great for training heavy, but when you can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars on a bar that has a very specific use for only a certain few exercises you can turn to your local hardware store and get a nice long pipe of PVC. It's perfect for rep sets and allows you to build muscle without spending major $$$.

But I’m finding that many people don’t think of pricing in any terms except lower prices = good, higher prices = bad. The early 2020 Chinese lockdowns halted their production, and then the US lockdowns halted US production and closed stores. Everyone was staying home and ordering home gym equipment until it was quickly all gone. Many people still aren’t going back to commercial gyms. When demand outstrips supply, to hit equilibrium again you basically either need to increase the supply or lower the demand by raising prices. The production rate of gym equipment is only going to increase so quickly. It’s big, heavy stuff. Factories and stores are reluctant to expand unless they’re confident that this is a long term trend. They also don’t want to raise prices too much and overshoot the mark. Eventually it should hit equilibrium. Things will be out of whack into 2021. Demand is only going to go up next month (see below). One thing I can tell you: The stores hate backorders as much as you do. Their business was not made to run that way. It just doesn’t work, in so many ways. In fact, that’s what caused me to close Adamant Barbell in April. Our suppliers ran out of stock and got hit by coronavirus lockdowns at the same time. Backorders piled up. I saw the writing on the wall and said, “That’s it, I’m out.” On the bright side, things are better every month at this point. Getting a barbell is almost a non-issue now. Dumbbells are still spotty, but some sizes are staying on the shelves better.","tags":"video, compartir, teléfono con cámara, teléfono con video, gratuito, subir","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WG439w7T3fU/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdQ5smU2nL4","title":"The Best Home Gym Equipment You Should Buy | My Home Gym Tour","description":"HOME BODYWEIGHT TRAINING GUIDE: https://marinokatsouris.co.uk/ Shop Myprotein: http://tidd.ly/6f1dd1d5 Use Code MARINOVIP Shop Alphalete: https://alphalete.eu/?rfsn= Use Code Marino Shop Legend London Jeans https://www.legendlondon.co/ Use Code Marino Follow us on Instagram: Dominique: https://www.instagram.com/domiwaffles...

What should you choose? How much should you be spending? What I chose for my gym and why. What brands are the best? Should you even buy equipment now that gyms are opening again? A couple of the top brands we at Third Street Barbell decided to go with are Sorinex, Rogue, Hammer Strength, Umax Dumbells and Powerlift. When all of the gym equipment is here and assembled by us, we will have a full gym tour video out. Here are the descriptions and links for all of those companies below. Sorinex - almost 40 years later, Sorinex is still a family owned business and employs more people than ever. Sorinex is the most sought after strength brand for professional teams, colleges, high schools and military bases. Some of our designs have changed the face of strength training forever, and can be found in almost any serious gym in the world. During this process of growth, our clients have become an extended family to us, part of our brotherhood. We realize we are still around because of our great customers and friends. We want to take the opportunity to thank YOU, our customers, supporters, vendors and friends for being the foundation on which Sorinex is built. Without you, there is no Sorinex. We promise to do our best to serve you with the best strength training equipment and service in the industry. https://www.sorinex.com/pages/our-story Rogue - an American manufacturer and distributor of strength and conditioning equipment, including weightlifting barbells, plates, racks and other fitness related equipment for CrossFit boxes, personal garage gyms, military, collegiate, and professional sports teams. https://www.roguefitness.com Hammer Strength - Life Fitness is an American fitness equipment company that specializes in the production and distribution of equipment such as stationary bikes and treadmills. They developed the industry's first electronic stationary bicycle. As of 2015, the company has over 1,700 employees and twelve manufacturing facilities around the world. https://www.lifefitness.com/en-us/hammer-strength Umax Dumbells - The year 2000 marked the beginning of our experience in designing and building commercial weight products - under our parent company SDM, an OEM manufacturer. In 2007 the d.b.a. Umax Strength was released with our own U.S. design and engineering patents and a year after that, in 2008, we aggressively marketed the Umax brand to the health club industry and commercial fitness equipment distributors. In just a few short years, Umax twice outgrew our California based facility, even in the midst of a tough global economy. We use our own U.S. patents, and hybrid overseas and domestic manufacturing, to build superior products at the lowest prices.

Build an affordable home gym in 2020! Home gym equipment essentials. Where to look for gym equipment There are a few places you should look at. You can look at the old school craigslist for used gym equipment. Older people who aren’t familiar with smartphones tend to post their items for sale on craigslist. You can also get the two most popular apps, offerup, and letgo. These apps are great because you can communicate with the sellers really quickly. You can message back and forth until you arrive at the price that you both agree on. The downside is that you need to know what you are buying and how much you are willing to spend. Gym equipment sells really quickly so you have to know the market value of the product you are trying to purchase so you don’t lose out. How much should you pay You need to do your research so that you know what a fair price is. The market is going to change depending on supply and demand. If there is high availability of gym equipment you can get away with paying much less than if there’s a pandemic and no one is manufacturing weights since they’re “non-essential”. In a good market you can expect to pay less than a dollar per pound, about 90 cents is reasonable. If there is a pandemic people will charge up to $2 dollars a pound so anything within that range is fair. How to negotiate a better price The key to negotiating a better price is to make the seller aware of your situation. A lot of sellers who are flipping equipment for a profit think that if they sell you something for a lower price, you will turn around and sell it for higher and make a profit off of them. Reassure them that you are building a home gym because you really enjoy working out and this is the last piece of equipment that you need. Something along those lines will help you secure a lower price than what they were initially selling it for. Avoid ads that say they are firm on price unless you agree with the price off the bat. These people are interested in maximizing their profit and won’t be willing to drop their prices. Constantly be on the lookout and set up notifications for the gym equipment you are searching for. That way as soon as it drops you can be the first to give an offer. There are people who don’t understand the market or aren’t in it for the money and they will post things very very cheap. What you shouldn’t buy Some of the gym equipment I recommend you buy if you are starting to build your home gym are a barbell, dumbbell handles, and lots of plates. You’ll also want a bench preferably the kind that will incline, and decline. Those are what I find super essential since its what I use the most. If you find a good deal on a squat rack I would also grab it because it makes lifting without a spotter way easier. Be minimalistic and truthful as to what you do and don’t need. Remember to be mindful when it comes to the budget you set for your gym. Checking offerup every 15 minutes and finding some thing to buy everytime is going to hurt you in the long run. You don’t need all types of gadgets if you stick to basic compound full body movements. The only thing you will manage to do is clutter your garage, overspend on useless equipment you might never use.","tags":"Back to the gym, used gym equipment, where to buy gym equipment, cheap gym equipment, free gym equipment, gym, gym tour, workout, workout motivation, interior design, gym gear, gym equipment, gym equipment review, CAP, affordable gym equipment, home gym inspo, home gym equipment, inexpensive home gym equipment, amazon gym equipment review, fitness equipment, fitness, fitness youtuber, gym haul, 2020, home gym, amazon, amazon review, gym review, home gym equipment essentials","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V2JQJ9QC1K4/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3cMGYTMQc","title":"Top 5 Cardio Machines At Your Gym","description":"Download My Workout App Exerprise FREE - https://bit.ly/2H7eHen Eric tells you about the 5 most common types of machine cardio equipment at the gym.

You're in luck because if you're trying to lose weight or burn that last bit of belly fat with cardio this video will help. Many men \\u0026 women perform cardio at home or in the gym for fat burning purposes, but the top exercises and machine help burn the most calories. Learn which ones are best. 🔥 FREE 6 Week Body Transformation Challenge: http://bit.ly/lose-fat8 ☝️☝️☝️ 📲 Fat Loss Calculator: http://bit.ly/2RdaxXn Timestamps: Limited Amount of Research: 0:32 Energy Expenditure Study: 1:25 What Cardio Machine Do You Enjoy Using?: 3:07 Which Machine Requires You To Stand/Work Muscles?: 4:06 Do You Only Want to Burn Fat?: 4:49 Which Machine is Best For Your Joints?: 5:55 Cardio at a High Intensity: 6:48 Long Duration Steady State Cardio: 7:38 High Intensity Interval Training: 7:55 You're looking to lose some body fat, and you decide to incorporate some cardio to help you do it a little faster. So you walk into the gym looking for the machine that produces the best results, or you might be thinking about even buying a cardio machine for your house. In either case you see all kinds of different pieces of cardio equipment to choose from. Tredmills, stariclimbers, elipticals, bikes, and rowing machines are just a couple options you can choose from. So which one do you choose, which one is the best for burning fat. Well that's what I'll help you answer in today's video. Let's start first with some science. Unfortunately there's a very limited amount of research available when it comes to comparing different cardio machines and the effect they have on fat loss. And this is because for one it's difficult to attribute fat loss directly to cardio because cardio isn't the only thing that effects fat loss. Obviously your diet plays a huge role, cardio gives you the ability to eat more food while still burning fat, but you can actually burn all the fat you want just by dieting alone. There are also other factors like how active a person is throughout the day when they're not exercising or how fast their resting metabolism is, and these factors make it very difficult to set up a study that can show a direct relationship between cardio and pounds lost on the scale. But what we do know is that if we can get our heart rate higher and keep it elevated for longer portions of our workout, we'll burn more calories per minute. So one study that was published in the Journal of American Medical Association compared 6 different cardio machines and the effects they had on heart rate as well as calories burnt during the workout. In this study they looked at the Airdyne bike, a cross-country-skiing simulator, a cycling bike, a rowing machine, a stair stepper, and a treadmill. On all the machines the partcipants were asked to give an rpe which stands for ratings of perceived exertion. This basically involved rating the difficulty from 11 to 15 with 11 being fairly light, 13 being somewhat hard, and 15 being hard. This was how they were able to establish a comparable intensity level between all these different machines. Once the intensity levels between all the machines were fixed and equal the researchers found that the tredmill produced the highest heart rates, and it had the highest rates of energy expenditure, meaning it burned the most amount of calories. The stairclimber came in as a close second producing the second highest heart rates. The rowing machine and skiing machine were pretty much tied for third followed by the cycling bike and the airdyne bike. When compared directly to cycling the tredmill required 40 percent more energy expenditure than the bike at the same intensity level. 40 percent is definitely a signifcant difference. So does this mean that everyone should just spend all their time on the tredmill? The answer is no because there are other factors at play here that make the best cardio machine for you a very individual \\u0026 personal choice. So I've come up with 5 quick questions that you can ask yourself to find out which cardio machine is actually the best for you. Number one and most important is which cardio machines do you actually enjoy doing or if you don't enjoy any of them which one do you hate the least. This should be the very first question you ask because even if you do burn more calories on the tredmill, but you hate doing it so much that you never use it, well that's not going to help you burn very much fat at all. If you enjoy your weekly cycling class so much that you never miss a single workout, but whenever you plan to go running outside you find an excuse not to then cycling is way better for you than using a tredmill. Consistency is a very important...

Find out the best workout split for building maximum muscle gains and overall performance. There is a key message that you will not want to miss when it comes to answering this question truthfully and without relying on simple studies to do so. When we talk about workout splits we are referring to the way that you break up your training over a period of time. Generally, this is the amount of workouts that it takes to complete one cycle of training and that ensures that you are hitting all of the areas you are attempting to target in your workouts. One of the most popular ways to split up workouts right now is actually one of the oldest in the books, and that is total body training. This refers to performing three total body workouts per week, generally on a Monday, Wednesday and a Friday with the remainder of the days either being reserved for conditioning or rest. The benefits to this type of training are the higher focus on compound lifts that are designed to hit maximum muscle in each lift as well as the increased time for recovery. Additionally, as science would indicate, hitting a muscle (even with a lower daily volume) more frequently in a training cycle is one of the most effective ways to make it grow. This would mean that if you were once following a more traditional bro split where you trained say chest just once per week with twelve to sixteen sets you would now be doing it as four to five sets per day over the three days in the week. The restimulation of the chest every 48 hours is sufficient to increase muscle protein synthesis without waiting too long to hit the muscle again (as would happen with a bro split - or at least a poorly planned one). Does that mean that bro splits don’t work? Not at all. In fact, this is one of those instances of throwing the baby out with the bath water. Nobody could argue that the single muscle group per day routine has been effective for some. Maybe not as much as total body training, but there are many instances of it working well, and quite well to be exact. How can that be? How can something that is somehow proven by science to be inferior actually produce results that in some cases are superior? That is because the real best way to split your workout for maximum gains is to switch what you are doing when you can honestly answer that you have stopped making gains in either strength, size or both. Just because something is supposed to be the best doesn’t mean that it is best for you at this time. Changing your split may reveal to you that certain muscle groups of yours are more responsive on a different training cycle. The best you could do at that point is take the observations that you have made and use them to adapt your workout plan to idealize the volume and frequency that your body responds to the best. This video is meant to open your eyes to that possibility. If you are looking to change your current workout split and want to be sure you are putting the latest science into your workouts to make sure you get it right, head to the link below to pick the program best suited to your goals.

In this video, I take you through a workout for beginners that is 3 months in length, or possibly even longer if you decide to stick with the third month longer, that is designed to build both strength and muscle while making sure to build your body on a solid foundation. Each month consists of three workouts, two of which are full body workouts and one of which focuses on your core and grip/forearm strength. The total body workouts are alternated on monday, wednesday and friday while the core and carry workout is repeated every tuesday and thursday. The weekends are taken off for rest and recovery. The exercises in this beginner workout routine are grouped by movement patterns. Instead of focusing solely on specific exercises, I want the beginner trainee to think about how their bodies are moving and why that movement is important so that they may substitute in other exercises down the line with a knowledge of why they are acceptable alternatives. The ten movement patterns are: Squat Hinge Vertical Push Vertical Pull Horizontal Push Horizontal Pull Static Lunge Dynamic Lunge Core Flexion Carry Over the course of the 3 months of this beginner workout plan, you will see that the exercises that fit each movement pattern will change. By either increasing the complexity of the exercise or the amount of load that can be used on the exercise, we can ensure progressive overload is met while giving your muscles the stimulus they need to grow bigger and stronger. Eight of the ten movement patterns are split up across two full body workouts as shown in the video. Here is an example of how the A full body workout for beginners of month one is structured: 1. DB Drop Squat - 3 x 12-15 FF 2. 1 Arm DB Press - 3 x 12-15 FF each arm 3. Chest Supported Row - 3 x 12-15 FF 4. Bodyweight Split Squats - 3 x FF each leg Here is an example of how the B workout for beginners of month one is structured: 1. Pullthroughs - 3 x 12-15 FF 2. Bodyweight Reverse Lunges - 3 x 12-15 FF each leg 3. Pushups - 3 x FF 4. Lat/Banded Pulldowns - 3 x 12-15 FF Here is an example of how the C beginner workout of month one is structured: 1. Rollups - 3 x FF 2. DB Suitcase Carry - 3 x FF each arm As you make your way through months one, two and three you will see that the reps will decrease (progressing from movement mastery into strength overload) and the overall volume will increase and then become streamlined for maximum efficiency at the end. Any beginner who performs this total body workout for beginners can expect to see increases in the amount of muscle mass they carry as well as how they look and feel by the end of the routine. The majority of these workouts can be performed in any home gym, making this extremely friendly to anyone who is looking to build muscle but either cannot or does not want to go to the gym. A simple bench, barbell set and some dumbbells is all it takes for you to start building muscle as a beginner. If for some reason you cannot perform one of the exercises shown here, simply leave a comment below and someone will be able to recommend an alternative option that you will be able to do. All beginner workouts should have something in common, and that is a focus on learning the basics while paying attention to perform the exercises you are doing the right way. There is no point in building strength upon a cracked foundation. Learn how to control your body in space and master the movement patterns before adding weight to prevent unnecessary breakdowns down the line. Within these workouts you will find familiar exercises like pushups, squats, deadlifts, rows, pullups, lunges and more. The exercise progressions are what is important however and making sure not to move to an exercise that your body is not prepared to do properly at this time. The step by step workout plan for beginners is laid out as such to ensure that that doesn’t happen to you. Take it workout by workout and you will see that you can make great progress without any slips along the way.

Or in other words, simply figuring out how you’re going to group your exercises throughout the week. And although there isn’t one “best workout split” for everyone, certain muscle building splits have their advantages. For example, we know that training a muscle at least 2x/week is superior to 1x/week. This automatically makes the common bro split inferior to other higher muscle training frequency workout splits. Training splits like the upper lower split, full body workout splits (“total body workouts”), and the push pull legs workout split train each muscle 2x/week whereas the bro split does not. This not only helps better optimize protein synthesis but also enables you to get more quality sets done since your workout volume is spread out over multiple workouts. But which of these splits should you choose for mass? Well, it depends on your training experience. The best workout split for beginners looking to put on mass is likely a 3 day workout split with full body workouts. This is because you can train the compound lifts frequently and master them very quickly without causing too much muscle damage. Then, as you gain experience and need more volume to progress, you can switch to a 4 day workout split (such as the upper/lower split) to help spread out your volume better throughout the week. And then, as you progress even more, switching to a 5 day workout split or a 6 day workout split (push pull legs for example) would be wise to keep your workouts from being excessively long and fatiguing. However, despite what research says, it’s important to keep in mind that workout volume and consistency are the more important factors. So choose the workout split that you enjoy the most and best fits your schedule – as that’s going to be the best option for you! And if you’re looking for a step-by-step program that shows you how to optimize your training and nutrition in order to progress as efficiently as possible, then simply take my starting-point analysis tool below to find which program is best for you: https://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube\\u0026utm_medium=Video\\u0026utm_content=Description%20box\\u0026utm_campaign=Science%20based%20back%20split%20to%20maximize%20growth%20Jan%206%2F2019 LINK TO WRITTEN ARTICLE: https://builtwithscience.com/best-workout-split/ FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM \\u0026 FACEBOOK: https://www.instagram.com/jeremyethier/ https://www.facebook.com/Jeremyethierfit/ MUSIC: https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired STUDIES: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729395 OTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/frequency-muscle/ https://mennohenselmans.com/optimal-program-design/","tags":"best workout split, workout split, workout splits, workout split for building muscle, muscle building split, total body split, bro split, total body workout, full body workouts, best split for muscle growth, best workout split to build muscle, training split, training splits, push pull legs, upper lower, upper lower split, workout splits for men, workout splits for mass, my workout split, 3 day workout split, 4 day workout split, workout split for beginners, jeremyethier","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9O8mOtdKr44/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OXtJ-JGaeQ","title":"Top 10 Grandparents You Won&#39;t Believe Exist - People Who Don&#39;t Age #3","description":"Top 10 Grandparents You Won't Believe Exist - People Who Don't Age #3 What flies into your psyche when you hear \\","tags":"top10 videosworld, you don&#39;t seem to age at all, celebrities who don&#39;t look their age, age is just number for them, 10 AMAZING PEOPLE, CREATIVE, Interesting, forever young, ageless, older, real age, look young, great, look amazing, exercise, working out, vegan, healthy eating, Edson Brandao, Gerald Maragos, Andy Wilkinson, Sheila Kiss, Lesley Maxwell, Mike Millen, Gunnar Paasche, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Top 10 Grandparents You Won&#39;t Believe Exist - People Who Don&#39;t Age #3","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1OXtJ-JGaeQ/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53bdqN_Zb8","title":"I Tried my Old IronMan Workouts for 7 Days *Brutal*","description":"For science-based home and gym workout programmes to build muscle, lose fat, or get athletic, my training + nutrition guides approved by a world-leading nutrition expert behind the British Olympic team are available on https://www.natachaoceane.com ❤️ —————————————————————————————— My Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/natacha.oceane/ —————————————————————————————— I always get questions about my training for my IronMan triathlon so I thought I’d share what a typical week of workouts looked like for me!

In this video, I’m going to give you a complete home workout routine with all sets and reps included to help you to build muscle regardless of whether or not you ever step foot in a gym. The key to the effectiveness of this perfect home workout is that it pairs exercises together in a way that allows you to train to greater overload than would be possible if you stuck with one single exercise, and it will keep the workouts brief at the same time. This perfect home workout consists of not one but two complete total body workouts. The first, workout A, is to be performed on Monday and Friday of week 1. Workout B is to be performed on Wednesday. In week 2, this is flipped so that A is performed once on Wednesday and B is performed on both Monday and Friday. You can continue to alternate the workouts in this way if you decide to do this for longer. This workout for home is going to allow you to hit your total body in under one hour. With this being the goal, the idea is not to try and hit each muscle with too many individual exercises since this could lead to an excessively long workout and potential for doing too much in the given workout. Instead, we select the exercises based on movement patterns that we know we want to hit to accomplish our goal of building muscle everywhere. These patterns are broken down below and the exercises included in each are shown. Keep in mind, there are two complete versions of each workout to be sure that the beginners and more advanced trainees can follow this program and get results from it. Here is how to construct the perfect home total body workout A: 1. SQUAT / ANTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Alt. Single Leg Box Squats (use low box if advanced / higher box for beginners) 1 1/2 Bottomed Out Squats (to failure) Jump Squats 2. UPPER PUSH (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Handstand Pushups OR Power Pushaways Rotational Pushups OR Knee Rotational Pushups Cobra Pushups (long head contracted) OR Knee Cobra Pushups 3. HINGE / POSTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Alt. Single Leg Heel Touch Squats (use “kickstand” if needed) Alt. Sprinter Lunges Plyo Sprinter Lunges (jump from higher position if more beginner) 4. UPPER PULL (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Pullups OR Seated Pullups Human Pullovers OR BW Sliding Pulldowns Inverted Chin Curls 5. ABS (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Reverse Corkscrews Black Widow Knee Slides Levitation Crunches 6. CORRECTIVE (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Angels and Devils COMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES) Here is how to construct the perfect home workout B: HINGE / POSTERIOR x 3 ROUNDS Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Single Leg) OR Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Dual Leg) Long Leg March High Hip Bucks LUNGE / ANTERIOR x 3 ROUNDS Alt. Crossover Step Ups Alt. Reverse Lunges Split Squat Jumps UPPER PUSH x 3 ROUNDS Variable Wall Pushups OR Knee Decline Pushups to Knee Flat Pushups Alt. BW Side Lateral Raises (from knees for beginners) Tricep BW Extensions (long head stretch) UPPER PULL x 3 ROUNDS Chin Ups OR Seated Chin Ups Inverted Rows Back Widows ABS x 2 ROUNDS Ab Halos V-Up Tucks Sit-Up Elbow Thrusts CORRECTIVE x 2 ROUNDS Reverse Hypers COMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES) If you are doing this workout just to try it out, then I would suggest you choose the workout A variation. That said, if you opt to do a more comprehensive total body split workout routine then you will want to either incorporate workouts A and B into a twice a week plan or, even better, alternating A and B on M, W and F each week.

When we think of a home workout, we assume that they’re inferior for muscle growth. For many bodyweight workout at home routines out there, this is true. But, this is simply because they aren’t designed properly. You can make comparable gains in muscle mass by using either lighter loads (like bodyweight exercises), or heavier weights in the gym. But there are a couple key points that people overlook when it comes to home full body workout routines. First off, is that you need to push to near failure for every single set you perform in this full body home workout routine. If you stop well short of failure during your sets then you’ll fail to fully activate all the motor units within your muscles. And you won’t experience the same amount of growth that you would when using heavy weights. Secondly, you need to be working with a weight or resistance that is at least 30-40% of your 1 rep max if you want to maximize growth. So 30-40% of your 1 rep max equates to around 30-40 reps per set. So, make sure you can’t do more than that for the following exercises. All that said, we’re now ready to dive into the full home workout. The first exercise we’ll use here are narrow grip push-ups with the hands placed in a diamond shape, which will be used to target the chest and triceps. Next, we’ll use the inverted row to target our overall back with most of the emphasis on the mid back for thickness. Then, the third exercise is pike push-ups, which mainly target the shoulders and triceps. Now, it’s time to target the back, primarily the lats, with a vertical pulling angle through the sliding lat pulldowns. The fifth of the bodyweight exercises is the bicep towel curls, which allows for arms isolation. Then, to target the long head of the triceps, you can simply switch over and perform tricep extensions in your setup for the bicep curls. For most of us, bodyweight squats just aren’t going to cut it. Which is why we’ll use the towel set up again to perform assisted pistol squats to target the quads and glutes. For the eighth exercise, we’ll move onto the Bulgarian split squat with your rear leg elevated on a platform, which will again further target the quads and glutes. Lastly, we’ll use the sliding leg curl to work the hamstrings through both hip and knee extension. Now, as for your home workout routine, just like your exercises in the gym, it’s vital that you get adequate rest of roughly 2 minutes between each of your sets. And to do so in this workout while saving time, you can perform the following upper body exercises in a superset fashion: Home workout (superset): SUPERSET: Diamond Push-Ups: (4 sets – 2 flat, 2 decline) Inverted row (4 sets) SUPERSET: Pike Push-ups (3 sets) Lat pulldowns on floor (3 sets) SUPERSET: Biceps towel curl: 2 sets Tricep bodyweight extensions: 2 sets Assisted pistol squat: 3 sets each side Bulgarian split squat 3 sets each side Hamstring leg curls: 4 sets I’d recommend performing this full body home workout 3-4 times a week. Guys I hope you enjoyed this one and I also hope you were able to see that it’s the little details like what I went through in this video that really are key to maximizing growth and to actually see progress with whatever workout routine you choose to do.

And that’s understandable. Belly fat is really easy to gain and notoriously hard to lose. It can seem as though no matter what exercises you try to lose belly fat and no matter how well you eat, the belly fat just won’t budge. And unfortunately, with exception to surgery, there is currently no proven method of being able to spot reduce fat from the belly. There is an exercise, however, that is incredibly underutilized yet powerfully effective when it comes to losing even the most stubborn belly fat. Today I’ll share what that is and how you can start using it right away to lose belly fat. Click below for a step by step plan to lose stubborn fat and build muscle: https://builtwithscience.com/your-potential-realized/?utm_source=YouTube\\u0026utm_medium=Video\\u0026utm_campaign=The+%231+Exercise+To+Lose+Belly+Fat+%28FOR+GOOD%21%29\\u0026utm_term=05%2F06%2F2022 Click below to subscribe for more videos: https://www.youtube.com/jeremyethier/?sub_confirmation=1 Why is belly fat is so hard to lose in the first place? Well, it comes down to the fact that certain areas of your body are easier to lose fat than others, and is largely determined by genetics. Now having your genetics stacked against you may seem problematic if you’re looking to develop a slim or lean looking abdomen, but there is a solution. As long as you create a calorie deficit, you will continue to lose fat. Eventually, if maintained long enough, you will lose excess fat from all areas of your body, even if your genetics put your belly fat at the back of the line. While diet should be your main way of creating a calorie deficit, adding additional exercises could help you to lose belly fat by keeping your metabolism high, even as you’re losing weight from dieting. That said, not all exercises are created equal. While things like running, rowing, cycling, or even HIIT workouts tend to burn calories very quickly, the truth is, the overwhelming majority of people can’t actually stick with traditional cardio long enough for fat loss to reach stubborn areas. And it’s not that these methods don’t work if you stick to it, because they do. The problem is simply that they’re brutal. They require a lot of willpower. Now don’t get me wrong, these forms of cardio definitely do have their place and some people have no problem sticking to them. In fact, I still do these intense sessions once or twice a week for conditioning. But I no longer rely on them as my main form of cardio to lose fat and nor should most people. Because if you want to lose your stubborn belly fat, and more importantly keep it off once it’s gone, then you need something you can stick to for life. What’s the solution? The best exercise to lose belly fat is walking. It’s the easiest to maintain, lowest stress, lowest fatigue, and most versatile form of cardio. According to research, intense forms of cardio like HIIT or running, while time efficient, didn’t provide any superior fat loss effect when compared to longer yet less intense forms of cardio such as walking. Which makes sense. It’s simply a numbers game. Your body doesn’t care whether the calories you burned were from some crazy intense fasted cardio session or from plain old walking. What matters most is what you can do consistently over time. And if you crunch the numbers, you’ll actually find that the calories burned from simply walking can very quickly add up to a meaningful amount. So now that I’ve hopefully convinced you of the power of walking, let’s dive into the specifics of how to lose belly fat from walking. The first step is to determine an average of how many steps you’re currently taking. You can use the health app on your iPhone or use Google Fit if you’re on Android. After a week, see what your daily average comes up to. Some of you however might be surprised with how few steps you’re taking, but this is a good thing, as it means you have a big opportunity to bump that up. Set a realistic goal and first aim to do an extra 2,000 steps a day. Given that the average individual takes about 1,200 steps during 10 minutes of walking, all you have to do is throw in two 10 minutes walks into your day to accomplish that. Once you’re consistent with that, try bumping it up by another 2,000 steps, and continue doing this with the goal of consistently getting at least 8,000 steps or even up to 15,000 steps, which seems to be the range that provides the greatest fat loss and health benefits. Trust me, the little things add up. Apply these tips and you’ll be surprised with just how much they increase your step count and even more surprised by how much of a difference it makes towards your fat loss overtime. That said guys, I want to emphasize that walking or any form of cardio is only effective for fat loss if it’s used in combination with a diet. So use your diet as the primary way to create a calorie deficit and supplement it with walking to help speed up the process.","tags":"how to lose belly fat, lose belly fat, belly fat, stubborn belly fat, exercises to lose belly fat, how to get rid of belly fat, how to burn belly fat, how to lose lower belly fat, best exercise to lose belly fat, how to reduce belly fat, burn belly fat, belly fat loss, reduce belly fat, builtwithscience, jeremyethier, lose stubborn fat, how to lose belly fat fast, lose belly fat fast, how to lose stubborn belly fat, belly fat exercises, how to lose stomach fat, body fat","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mEmynZt2SwY/hqdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6SeNMF1Pp0","title":"The 5 MOST IMPORTANT Exercises for Runners | Episode 40","description":"Timestamps: 0:00 Start 0:48 Why Strength Training is Important for Runners 2:24 Exercise 1: The Step Variation 3:48 Exercise 2: The Squat Variation 4:41 Exercise 3: The Calf Raise Variation 6:02 Exercise 4: Core Exercise (Hip Flexor) 6:48 Exercise 5: Full Body Exercise 8:20 Conclusion Public Service Announcement For All Runners - you need to watch this video! Strength training is an essential component for success with running, however, it is a common lacking component in most runner’s training programs. Due to the fact that the most common running injuries can be associated with lower extremity strength deficits, it is extremely important to educate runners why and how they should perform strength training. In this video, you’ll learn our top 5 favorite strength training exercises for runners, why they’re important, and slight modifications and variations so that you can find the best fit for you and your workout routine! Why is strength training important for runners? Running is an impact sport! Running can impose up to 8x your body weight in force on specific structures in the body. Because of this, running injuries are not uncommon, actually up to 50% of runners at some point in their life will experience an injury because of running. From research and our experience, we believe 80-90% of these injuries are due to training errors, with one of those errors being a lack of quality strength training! What should the exercises focus on? There are 3 components to running that should be addressed with strength training. Propulsion - meaning propelling the body forward with each step you take, this requires strength. Braking - being able to slow yourself down and control your body with each step you take while running, this also requires strength. Single leg - running is a single leg sport, thus you better include single leg strengthening exercises! Below you’ll find an outline of the exercises discussed in the video, be sure to watch the entire video to learn WHY these are important, how to perform them, and modifications/variations you can try out to see what best fits your workout routine! 1.

Find out exactly how often you should train each body part for faster results, and how many days per week you should workout in total based on your specific goals. 📲 Diet/Workout Calculator: http://bit.ly/gt-calculator45 🔥 6 Week Fat Loss Challenge: http://bit.ly/lose-fat446 What’s better training your entire body each session or training different body parts on separate days. Which style of training will help you burn more calories each session leading to greater fat loss? How about if you’re trying to build muscle, will have a separate chest day, back day, and a leg day allow you focus more on those specific muscles you’re trying to target ultimately helping you build more muscle and grow? Or can full-body training be just as effective for muscle growth? I’m going to answer all of these questions today and you may be a little surprised by some of these answers… So let’s begin with the pros and cons of each starting first with split training which is also referred to as “a bro split” and it’s usually the default type of training used by bodybuilders. With a very basic split training routine, you’ll be setting up your workout in a way where you’re focusing on only one muscle or one muscle group per day. So a typical basic split training routine might look something like this: Monday would be your chest day. Tuesday your back day. Wednesday would be your leg day. Then Thursday would be shoulders and abs, and then Friday would be biceps and triceps. Then Saturday and Sunday would be your two off days, and you would start the whole routine again on Monday by going back to chest. With full-body training, on the other hand, it's pretty obvious that you’re going be working your entire body every single session. That means unlike the bro split training you’ll be working your chest, back, arms, legs, and abs all in one day. Usually, a typical full-body training routine will have you working out three times a week with one day off in between each session. So Monday, Wednesday, and Friday would be full-body workouts and then the rest of the week you would have off. So which one of these is better for building muscle? Well, if we want to build muscle and increase our lean body mass faster we want to focus on increasing the volume of our workouts and volume is measured by 4 factors. Intensity, which is the amount of weight you’re lifting, frequency, which essentially is how many days a week you're working for a muscle group, and then there’s, of course, the total amount of sets, and reps that you’re performing. Increasing any of these 4 factors will help you build more muscle. Now immediately you may notice an advantage that full-body workouts provide over a basic split training routine. They require fewer days at the gym, only 3 instead of 5, and you’ll be targeting all the muscles in your body 3 times a week every week as opposed to split training where you’ll only be targeting each muscle once a week. That means that we’ll be increasing that frequency factor much higher with full-body training, and even if you do spend an entire workout session really beating up your chest with a split training routine, it shouldn’t take longer than a maximum of 3 to 4 days for your chest to recover, which means you’ll miss out on potential muscle gains, since you’ll be waiting 7 days to work your chest again instead of 4 days. So to make up for this lack of frequency other bro split routines have grown in popularity like push/pull routines, opposing body part routines, and upper/lower routines. A push/pull routine focuses on grouping your push muscles like your chest, shoulders, and triceps separately from your pull muscles like back and biceps. A typical routine may look like this: Day 1: Chest, shoulders, and triceps, Day 2: legs and abs, Day 3: Back and biceps, and Day 4 you would take off. Then you would repeat which would allow you to hit each muscle group twice a week. Now With an opposing body part routine, you would group two opposite muscle groups like your chest and back into one workout and each time you perform a set for your chest you would immediately perform another set with no break for your back. By super setting exercises like bench press and rows together you can still lift heavy for each exercise since each exercise works different muscles, and you can save time by pairing two sets together. An example routine would be Day 1: Chest and Back, Day 2: Would be a Leg day where you would be pairing quad and hamstring movements together and Day 3...","tags":"full body workout vs split training, full body training vs bro split, full body vs body part training, how many times a week should I workout, how many days a week should you workout, full body workouts, best workout split for muscle growth, total body workout or bro split training, bro split routines, whole body training vs split training, should I do full body workouts or split routines, is split training better than full body, how often should you train your muscles, bro split","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BmvZiGMhYXw/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM4sHl1hTEE","title":"How To Plan A Swim Workout | Structure Your Next Swimming Session","description":"So many swimmers jump in the pool and swim back and forth without a plan.

In order to maintain normal, pain-free function and movement, we have to be mindful of our flexibility and mobility - especially in our spines (collectively the most mobile part of our body). Our muscles and joints undergo what we call “adaptive shortening” and “adaptive lengthening” based on the stresses (or lack thereof) placed upon an area. Basically - our bodies and joints operate under a “use it or lose it” principle. If we don’t take our joints into their end ranges of available motion and if we stay fixed in one posture for an extended period of time, we start to lose our range of motion. This can result in feelings of tightness, stiffness, and even pain. The best way to combat these effects is by regularly taking your joints into ranges that they should go into and that they’re capable of going into, but don’t get there regularly. That’s where these exercises come in. This is a collection of the best exercises to stretch key muscles and joints into their end ranges of motion to increase your mobility and promote normal pain-free movement. Click on the time stamps below to be taken directly to each exercise in the video. 1. CHIN TUCKS (3:38) - My go-to exercise to decrease pain, tension, and even headaches in your cervical spine (neck). This is a must if you spend long periods of time in a “forward head posture” (working at a laptop, looking at a tablet or phone, etc). 2. NECK AND UPPER BACK EXTENSION STRETCHES (4:40) - Think about it - we rarely look up! Our whole lives are in front of us and we spend a lot of time looking straight or down. But our necks and our upper backs are designed to extend - to look up and move backwards. One of the best things you can do for your neck and upper back is to improve extension mobility. CORRECT YOUR UPPER BACK AND NECK POSTURE NOW: https://youtu.be/5R54QoUbbow 3. DOORWAY STRETCHES (6:54) - When we slump, our head comes forward on our necks and our shoulders round forward and in. To break out of this posture we need adequate range of motion through the front of the chest and shoulders. This is my go-to stretch to target those area. 4. LOWER BACK EXTENSION STRETCH (8:44) - We spend a lot of time sitting and many of our daily motions involve forward bending. Rarely do we extend our spines back the other direction in an effort to stretch them out. That’s where this stretch comes in. *Don’t do this one if you have certain specific spine conditions. If you’re dealing with back pain from things like stenosis, degenerative disc disease, or spondylolisthesis, please do not perform these extension exercises. You need to promote spine flexion (bending forward) to stretch your back out safely. BEST EXERCISES FOR DISC BULGE AND SCIATICA: https://youtu.be/fDkw-Zi5MBg 5. HIP FLEXOR STRETCH (10:40) - we spend a lot of time sitting. Over time our hip flexors can adapt and shorten in this position. The unfortunate part about this is one of your hip flexor muscles attaches to your lower back vertebrae. If your hip flexors are tight they can pull on these vertebrae and pull your back forward and out of proper alignment. HIP FLEXOR PAIN? YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS ONE: https://youtu.be/zTPfzlZbtz8 6. HAMSTRINGS STRETCH (12:13) - Probably the one area/muscle group that most of us could use a little work on - our hamstrings are an area that are prone to becoming tight. They also have a connection on the pelvis and can contribute to lower back pain if not stretched out properly.

Für mehr Flexibilität, Erholung \\u0026 Entspannung. Ja, auch dieses Video kommt ohne Voice-Over ;) Bewusst! Denn entgegen einer geführten Stretching- oder Yoga-Einheit ist man hier wirklich mal ganz bei sich! Nur du, die Musik, dein Atem und ein kleiner Beep hier und da ;) Vielleicht öffnest du dich also heute mal ganz unvoreingenommen für genau diesen Weg. Auch wenn es nur ein einziges Mal ist. Es wird anders anders sein - davon bin ich überzeugt. Denn wenn es im Aussen still ist, wird es Innen oftmals ganz schön laut. Ich möchte dich ermutigen, dich einzulassen… Die Positionen zu genießen und zu erforschen… Gedanken, die währenddessen aufkommen, einfach zu beobachten…Gut sein zu lassen…Anzunehmen… Loszulassen… Zu sein! Darüberhinaus ist diese Art des Praktizierens ein gute Möglichkeit für einen Übergang zu einer Yoga Self Practise - also das eigenständige Praktizieren.Die Asanas und die Zeit sind vorgegeben, aber die Instruktionen sind dieses Mal dir selbst überlassen.Falls du also schon ein Weilchen mit mir Yoga praktizierst, nutze die heutige „no-talking-session“ doch gerne für eine kleine Bestandsaufnahme in Sachen Ausrichtung und Mindset. Was machen die Schultern in der Vorbeuge, wo sind die Hände im Vierfüßler ausgerichtet und wie hieß nochmal der herabschauenden Hund auf Sanskrit… ;) Das ist nur eine kleiner Impuls meinerseits, denn in meinen Augen bieten uns unterschiedliche Situation nunmal unterschiedlichste Möglichkeiten. Wir müssen nur genau hinschauen und sie wahrnehmen… und annehmen! Wenn du nicht dennoch sträubst, auch in Ordnung ❤️.

To increase our energy, let's move and do workout together :) 안녕하세요, 올벤져스 여러분~올블랑 루이스입니다. 다들 집에 계시는 시간이 많아졌다고 운동을 게을리하지 않으실 거라고 믿고 있어요! 오늘의 운동은 매일 아침, 층간소음 없이 집에서 따라할 수 있는 운동 루틴입니다. 외부활동이 줄어들어 찌푸둥한 요즘! 매일 아침 같이 운동하고 에너지 만들어봐요:) Allblanc Free Workout Program (2021 Hourglass Body Challenge) : https://bit.ly/allblancworkoutprogram 마이프로틴(MYPROTEIN) 할인 구매링크! 👉🏻 http://tidd.ly/54ad296a 할인코드(D/C Code) \\","tags":"home workout, fatloss, no gym, home training, 홈트레이닝, no gym workout, abs, cardio, 타바타 운동, tabata song, tabata workout, total body workout, six packs, allblanc tv, 올블랑tv, 뱃살빼기, tabata, quarantine home workout, morning workout","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fLLScgWQcHc/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzD80vCLq0Y","title":"Best Home Ab Workout | 10 Minutes (GUARANTEED!)","description":"This is the best home ab workout you will find if you are looking for one you can do without any equipment and whether you are a beginner or advanced. In this video, I’m going to give you a 10 minute follow along ab workout that is going to help you get six pack abs in the comfort of your own home. The key to any successful home abs workout is that you can do it in little space without needing any special equipment. Every one of the seven home ab exercises in this routine are something you can do with just your own bodyweight and nothing else. The structure of the ab workout is simple. There are 7 exercises, each performed for 60 seconds. If you are a beginner and cannot make the entire 1 minute of the exercise, simply perform it for as long as you can. Over time, you will be able to build up your endurance on these ab exercises and be able to last the entire duration as you carve out your 6 pack. Some of the exercises are designed to be done for 30 seconds to each side or in each direction. They will be noted both in the video description as well as in the video itself. After each 1 minute of ab exercise performance you will get 30 seconds to rest. During this time, I will describe what the next exercise is and how to perform it best for the greatest results. What makes this the best home abs workout is that it is something that can easily be saved in favorites and come back to day after day for even better abs and results. Here is how the workout breaks down: 1. Ab Halos - 30 seconds CW/CCW | 30 seconds rest 2. Frog Crunches - 60 seconds | 30 seconds rest 3. Russian Rows - 60 seconds | 30 seconds rest 4. Thread the Needle - 30 seconds each side | 30 seconds rest 5. Black Widow Knee Slides - 60 seconds | 30 seconds rest 6. Frog Circles - 60 seconds | 30 seconds rest 7. Sliding Ab Tucks - 60 seconds | 30 seconds rest Don’t worry if you can’t make it the entire 60 seconds right now. The key to getting six pack abs is to perform to the best of your ability and make sure that you are consistently training your core. This simple home ab workout is one that can be done every single day. It’s only going to take you 10 minutes and is something that won’t require any equipment at all. The problem with most ab workouts for men and women is that they rely too heavily on the hip flexors in the ab exercises that are chosen. That is a mistake. When the hip flexors are used too much they become dominant and tend to trigger the ab muscles to take a step back in contributing to the exercises. You do not want this. Tight and overdeveloped psoas will pull on the lumbar spine leading to the low back pain that is commonly felt by those that do the wrong ab workouts. This is the best home abs workout for that reason. Even people with low back pain should be able to perform this routine without compromising the health of their backs. The format of this will allow you to hit play and quickly get right into your ab workout at home. People often ask how often they should train their abs. I tell them, if possible, every single day. The core muscles were built for endurance and are capable of handling high frequency. I advise doing ab workouts at home since the consistency of them will dramatically improve. If you had to go to the gym just to train your abdominals, many people would simply not do them often enough to see the results needed to develop a 6 pack. Try this intense home ab workout for yourself and you’ll see just how fast you can get abs with the right routine.

You’ve put on a bit of muscle and lost some belly fat, but there’s a lot more to be desired. And of course, those sweet days of newbie gains in which you add 10 lbs to the bar every week and rapidly see changes in the mirror are long gone! Fortunately, there’s a simple way to get through this roadblock: and that’s by increasing training volume and incorporating advanced forms of periodization. Do this wrong, however, and you’ll be putting yourself at risk of under-recovery, rendering your hard work useless. In this video, I’m going to break down the best 5-day split for muscle growth and share a fool-proof template that you can follow.

Plank position is a simple, yet effective, exercise that is quick and easy to do, engages multiple muscle groups, and brings great benefits. If you regularly do planks, you’ll benefit from strengthening your abdominal muscles for a toned belly, flat stomach, six-pack abs and a stronger inner core. With proper form, you’ll find that planks strengthen your back muscles to build a stronger core to get rid of back pain and help with better posture. Planks also help you increase your flexibility, balance, and muscle endurance. WHAT MUSCLES ARE USED IN PLANK POSITION? When you are performing planks, you are engaging many muscle groups throughout your entire body including your back, chest, shoulders, arms, abs, butt, legs and neck. Plank position also works muscles around your shoulders, collarbone, shoulder blades, hamstrings and even the arches of your feet. HOW OFTEN SHOULD I DO PLANK POSITION? Plank position is a great core and ab workout. If your goal is to get a six-pack, plank position is a beneficial exercise that will get you an incredible, sculpted midsection. Plan on including an ab workout, such as planks, about 2-3 times per week. When you choose exercises for your ab workout routine, choose a variety of core exercises to work your abs, not just crunches and planks. Now to the workout. All you need is a stopwatch and a little space. We’re going to be switching up primarily between straight planks and side planks; try to keep your body up the whole time (don’t ever let it relax – just go straight in to the next exercise).

In fact, it's estimated that about 80% of us will experience some form of significant lower back pain in our lives. That means if you haven't had it yet, chances are you will at some point in the future. One of the best ways you can avoid lower back pain is to keep the muscles that support and stabilize your spine strong and healthy. Today I wanted to share with you 5 of my favorite exercises that you can do at home with zero equipment required to strengthen and tone your lower back and help decrease and eliminate low back pain. POSTERIOR CHAIN STRENGTHENING One of the most-often overlooked muscle groups when it comes to lower back and core strengthening is the glutes. Your gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus attach to your pelvis and help to form the foundation upon which your lower back is built. If you want to strengthen your back and eliminate pain, it's imperative that we include exercises that strengthen your glutes as well. HOW TO INCREASE LOWER BACK STRENGTH The lumbar spine or lower back is an area not known for much motion. In fact, it is supposed to be a stable area that is less susceptible to injury and able to hold up to the rigors of heavier lifting and training. If your lower back is weak and required to do too much work, it can easily break down. In order to work to its best, the low back has to get assistance from the glutes to help with extension of the posterior chain from the bottom up as well. The muscles of the low back are asked to fire for long periods of time throughout the day. Often, they have become dormant and underactive because of prolonged sitting. In order to keep them strong, it is important to regularly train these muscles and help to improve the endurance of them. The five exercises shown below will keep your back muscles strong without requiring any expensive or elaborate back extension machines or equipment. ====================================================== 7 Days of healthy recipes and home workouts delivered right to your inbox! Click here to get started: https://goo.gl/9UncDf ====================================================== 5 OF THE BEST LOWER BACK EXERCISES YOU CAN DO AT HOME 1. BRIDGE - Lay on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor. - Squeeze your butt and lift your hips up off of the floor. Lift your hips as high as you can comfortably. - Hold five seconds and slowly return to the starting position. - Perform three sets of 10 repetitions. 2. SINGLE-LEG BRIDGE - Lay on your back with your right leg bent, left leg out straight. - Contract your right glute and use your right hip muscles to lift your pelvis up off of the floor. Your left leg should remain out straight. - Hold 3-5 seconds and return to the starting position. - 10 repetitions on the right, 10 repetitions on the left, repeated three times. 3. SWIMMER - Lay on your stomach with your arms stretched out over your head. - Raise your right arm and left leg completely up off of the ground. Hold 1-2 seconds and then return to the starting position. - Repeat with your left arm and right leg. - Perform 10 repetitions on each side and repeat three times. 4. SUPERMAN - Lay on your stomach with your arms stretched out over your head. - Completely lift your chest and legs up off of the floor and hold 2-3 seconds. - Slowly return to the starting position. - Perform 10 repetitions and repeat 3 sets. 5. BODYWEIGHT DEADLIFT - Stand upright with your feet shoulder width apart. - Keep you back straight as you hinge forward at your hips. - Bend as low as you can go (down to torso parallel to the floor) and then use your glutes and lumbar extensors to return back upright to the starting position. - Perform 10 reps and repeat three times. Remember - in order to effectively strengthen your back at home it's imperative that you include glutes into your exercises. Focus on strengthening the entire posterior chain and you'll be amazed at your results!","tags":"lower back workout, low back pain, low back exercises, lower back exercises, back pain, lower back pain, best exercises for lower back, best exercises or low back pain, lower back exercises at home, best lower back exercises, lower back exercises no equipment, lower back workout at home, how to strengthen lower back, strengthen lower back fast, lower back strength, lower back pain exercises, core exercises, how to strengthen core, core workout, back exercises","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2daigSBkx68/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxMvjh1IX4","title":"Physiotherapy COVID 19 RECOVERY Exercise Routine at Home","description":"Covid19 recovery exercises at home guided by Physiotherapist Michelle https://www.pelvicexercises.au This gentle safe strength exercise routine helps avoid potential side effects of Covid bed rest; loss of strength, blood clots, chest infection and lower back pain. These strength exercises promote wellness and return to regular activity, maintain strength after Covid 19. *** Get Michelle's app NOW online at www.pelvic.app ** Copy and paste address into your browser.

If at any time during this exercise routine you feel dizzy or breathless, stop, take a break and return to the exercises when you feel fully recovered. Never perform intense exercise with a high temperature (i.e. febrile). Covid Recovery Strength Exercise Routine Outline This exercise routine includes bed or chair based exercises with options for different stages of recovery and levels of fitness. 1. Breathing Exercises * Sit upright in bed or on the side of your bed * Place your hands around the lower part of your rib cage * Breathe slowly and deeply in through your nose and then let the air slowly leave your lungs. Don't be concerned if deep breathing makes you cough as this is quite normal when starting to breathe deeply again after shallow breathing while resting in bed. 2. Neck and Shoulder Stretches Shoulder rolls, stretch forwards and out behind to relieve tight neck, shoulder and upper back muscles 3. Seated Marching Can be performed sitting over the side of the bed or in a chair 4. Sitting to Standing Strengthens your leg muscles and increases circulation to prevent blood clots on your legs. *Walk your bottom to the edge of the bed so your feet are flat on the ground *Do NOT wear socks, bare foot or fitted shoes are the safe alternative * Put your hands on the bed beside your body *Bring shoulders forward over your knees to stand upright *Push down through your heels and stand up slowly * Feel for the bed touching behind your knees * Lower your body slowly back to sitting position 5. Marching on the Spot Promotes circulation to prevent blood clots and helps maintain general fitness 6. Lumbar Rotations Eases low back pain and stiffness caused by bed rest 7. Bridging Exercise Strengthens buttocks, improves circulation and prevents blood clots in calves. Perform this exercise lying on a firm surface in bed or on the ground. 8. Calf Pump Exercises Improves circulation (blood flow) to the lower legs to prevent blood clots. Try to do these exercises hourly when resting lying down or sitting out of bed. Comfortable Elevated Bed Rest Position at Home When at home, resting with the upper body raised promotes deeper breathing, better circulation and can help clear the chest. This is why it's important to spend some time sitting upright in bed or in a chair out of bed at regular intervals during the day when able to.

(Morning vs Evening)","description":"The time of day in which you train is something you’ve probably never taken into much consideration – but surprisingly, research shows that there’s actually a “best time of day to workout” that not only provides slightly greater strength gains and boosts performance, but seems to significantly accelerate the rate of muscle growth. Therefore, choosing whether you should perform a morning vs evening workout is something you should likely consider! And long story short – research tends to show that late afternoon or evening/night workouts tend to be the best time to train when compared to morning workouts. This is because in the evening, you’re more hydrated, more fueled with glycogen, and most importantly your core body temperature is at its highest. Since we know that core body temperature is highly correlated with exercise performance, this is likely why research tends to show that a workout at a night trumps morning workouts. However, before you go ahead and change your workout schedule, it’s important to note that there are benefits to both morning and night workouts. And if you prefer morning workouts over evening workouts, then what you can do to minimize any performance decrements is simply: ingest caffeine prior to your workout, ensure you’re adequately warmed up before your workout in order to raise your core body temperature, and be consistent with the time of your workout! But all in all, in the grand scheme of things, the time of your workout is not something you should stress over. Simply choose a workout time that best suits your schedule – because consistency and adherence to your training program are the most important factors when it comes to what will deliver you results!

This video took a lot longer than I expected... I ended up making a lot of mistakes and had to redo parts of it. Irony? Haha. I had to cut out a lot of clips to make it fit. For example, regarding spot reduction, it's not CURRENTLY thought to be possible, but there are fringe studies that have tested the theory. I don't personally buy into it, but I ideally I would have brought that up to ward off potential arguments. In addition, while we may not be able to spot reduce with exercise, there may be others things we can do. For example, low-carb diets have been shown to help reduce visceral fat. I recommend everyone do their own research on the subject and come to their own conclusions! I'm certainly not the final opinion. The second mistake I cover involves exercising too much. After a long period of inactivity, we're often suddenly inspired. Sometimes it's by someone we see on television. For some of us it's watching Rocky. For others, it's Naruto. Everyone is a bit different, I guess. It's better, in my opinion, to start off with low intensity exercises at a volume you can sustain and scale. You can go on a walk every morning, for example. You could also do a proper workout 2-3x a week. And then you can scale up the volume and difficulty after a few weeks of sustaining this routine. The third mistake is investing in too much equipment. We can't buy our fitness and health, so we shouldn't let others try to sell it to us.

I’ve been doing this for 12 + years and every week I share my best strategies with you. While I'm now doing quite well with my business, I was spinning my wheels for years before I finally figured it out through trial and error! I had to learn it all the HARD WAY with many dead-end roads and a few hundred thousand spent. So my goal is to help you get to where I'm at (or even better!) by showing you how to create an online business that will actually work without wasting tons of time and money on the wrong ideas! Many of my viewers are trying to build life-changing income streams part-time, without a lot of experience, and without a big budget to get started. Everything I teach is designed to help you maximize your earnings, do more with less, eliminate unnecessary risks, and see results as soon as possible.

What this means is that if you click on one of my links and buy the product or service recommended, I’ll receive a small commission. The cost of the service or product is still the same to you (or sometimes cheaper if I can get you a deal as a partner) because it's the vendor who pays this commission. This helps support the channel and allows me to continue making videos like this. My promise to you is that I will never promote a product or service that I myself don't use or believe in.

Money is something that doesn’t fascinate me but the impact and difference that could be created in someone’s life because of me. #Shorts -------------------------------------------- Our Top Rated Playlist Founders Unfiltered - Learning from the Greats - https://bit.ly/3vxIWFt FREE Advanced Digital Marketing Course- https://bit.ly/3bRvFQw Sales Training- https://bit.ly/3s4ZpPe FREE Online MBA-https://bit.ly/3rSjNmX Case Study/ Business Model- https://bit.ly/3lmAMLA -------------------------------------------- Follow Intellectual Indies- Website- http://bit.ly/2NrfArk Instagram-https://bit.ly/3cB62Cr Twitter- https://bit.ly/2NnyX4x Facebook Page- http://bit.ly/2ODvOhp YouTube Channel-http://bit.ly/2LI49WI -------------------------------------------- Other YouTube Channels : Intellectual Indies http://bit.ly/2LI49WI Sahil Khanna http://bit.ly/2NlUNFp Intellectual Shorts http://bit.ly/3bR97iD Ask Sahil Khanna https://bit.ly/3lMLRpe","tags":"7 tips for crafting the perfect sales pitch, sales pitch, sales, crafting sales pitch, business pitch, creating sales pitch, perfect pitch, sales pitch tips, writing sales pitch, the perfect pitch, tips, perfect business pitch, how to craft a saas sales pitch, perfect elevator pitch for introverts, sales tips, sales techniques, sales motivation, sales advice, how to sell anything, sales training, how to close, how to sell, sales coaching, closing the sale, closing sales","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YjnY25zzOPY/hq2.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mQazrFw5fiA","title":"How to start a startup #startup #entrepreneur #money #business #investing #startupideas","description":"how to start a startup unicorns how to invest in startups how to start a business business ideas startup ideas","tags":"startups, business, entrepreneur, entrepreneurship, angel investment, unicorns, entrepreneurs, businessman","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mQazrFw5fiA/hq2.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZxYZZ151To","title":"Life at a Bangalore Startup! 0 to a $100 Million Company!

For many founders, getting picked by a top accelerator program feels like the holy grail of early stage entrepreneurship. Overnight, you and your team are given access to world-class mentorship, tight accountability, educational events, and primetime pitching opps. In short - all things needed to get you to the next level - FAST. But the popularity of accelerators is a double-edged sword… leading to intense competition between you and your fellow founders. Acceptance rate hovers around 3-5%. For the more popular ones (Y Combinator and TechStars) that number is actually closer 1%. But my message for you today is simple. You… and ONLY you, get to dictate the success of your startup. And if you’re part of the majority of founders who DON’T get picked by a startup accelerator, not only am I going to show you the 5 ways to create your OWN… … but also, why doing so can actually lead to bigger outcomes than the traditional route. As you can see from the video, there’s nothing contained within even the world’s most elite programs that you can’t create on your own. Mentorship… Education… Pitching… Deadlines… They’re all within grasp once you put these 5 strategies into play. In fact, I’ll argue all day that doing so is, even more, powerful than landing in an accelerator program. Because when you claim personal ownership across these areas, you also make massive upgrades to your Founder’s Operating System http://www.danmartell.com/os/. You build up the self-reliance muscles that will serve you throughout your ENTIRE entrepreneurial journey... not just the short-term track that an accelerator would’ve led you through. So that’s my message for you today. Give it a watch and let me know in the comments which of these 5 strategies you plan to implement this week. (Number 1 and 4 can be done in as little as 10 minutes a day). And as always, please share it with anyone you know who’s considered going down the accelerator route. To driving your own success (and pushing it full throttle), - Dan P.S. Finding a mentor is undoubtedly one of the most crucial areas for any founder to focus on. Here’s my best advice on how to land a TOP mentor (without being part of an accelerator). http://www.danmartell.com/findingamentor/ Don't forget to share this amazing entrepreneurial advice with your friends, so they can be inspired too: https://youtu.be/b8fTFoAWyiE ===================== ABOUT DAN MARTELL ===================== “You can only keep what you give away.” That’s the mantra that’s shaped Dan Martell from a struggling 20-something business owner in the Canadian Maritimes (which is waaay out east) to a successful startup founder who’s raised more than $3 million in venture funding and exited not one... not two... but three tech businesses: Clarity.fm, Spheric, and Flowtown. You can only keep what you give away. That philosophy has led Dan to invest in 33+ early stage startups such as Udemy, Intercom, Unbounce, and Foodspotting. It’s also helped him shape the future of Hootsuite as an advisor to the social media tour de force. An activator, a tech geek, an adrenaline junkie and, yes, a romantic (ask his wife Renee), Dan has recently turned his attention to teaching startups a fundamental, little-discussed lesson that directly impacts their growth: how to scale. You’ll find not only incredible insights in every moment of every talk Dan gives - but also highly actionable takeaways that will propel your business forward. Because Dan gives freely of all that he knows. After all, you can only keep what you give away.

On the product side, you are essentially trying to find the perfect combination of audience, pain point, and solution. While marketing or sales are of course essential, you can hire the best marketing team with all the money in the world, and they still wouldn’t be able to make a flawed product succeed. We have over a 100 Forensics episodes to prove it. A customer hypothesis could be ‘first-time startup founders’, a problem hypothesis is that ‘they don’t know how to navigate fundraising’ - and a solution hypothesis could be an intensive accelerator program, or a Skillshare course, or a suite of SaaS tools that guide you through the steps. A company’s lifetime is how many times they can iterate on these three ideas to find product-market fit before they run out of money.

He has a crazy gift. Essentially, he doesn’t know how to get involved in a startup and NOT have it turn into a billion dollar success story. We’re talking about… … Paypal (sold to ebay for 1.5B) … Yammer (sold to Microsoft for 1.2B) … dozens of companies he was an angel investor in (Airbnb, Facebook, Uber) He’s as close to a “tech oracle” as there is… And if you have billion dollar aspirations for your startup… you better be taking his advice as gospel. I was lucky enough to attend a private keynote that David gave a few years back where he singled out the 5 things that MUST be true to hit the 10 figure mark. This week’s video is the detailed breakdown extracted from my personal notebook. At a high level, here are the 4 things that must be true: 1. Market need 2. Product hook 3. Scalable distribution model 4. A non-copyable moat Even if you’re not crazy enough to have billion dollar aspirations, building your company as if you do will set you up for massive scale. If there’s one element that has to be true for ANY company (not just billion dollar startups)... it’s the market need. I know… obvious on the surface… … but still a mistake that way too many founders make. Falling in love with our technology will do that ;-) Give this episode a watch, and then reply to this email letting me know the ultimate aspirations for your startup. Dan “dare to go big” Martell Don't forget to share this entrepreneurial advice with your friends, so they can learn too: https://youtu.be/3D4AKjFyHZM ===================== ABOUT DAN MARTELL ===================== “You can only keep what you give away.” That’s the mantra that’s shaped Dan Martell from a struggling 20-something business owner in the Canadian Maritimes (which is waaay out east) to a successful startup founder who’s raised more than $3 million in venture funding and exited not one... not two... but three tech businesses: Clarity.fm, Spheric and Flowtown. You can only keep what you give away. That philosophy has led Dan to invest in 33+ early stage startups such as Udemy, Intercom, Unbounce and Foodspotting. It’s also helped him shape the future of Hootsuite as an advisor to the social media tour de force. An activator, a tech geek, an adrenaline junkie and, yes, a romantic (ask his wife Renee), Dan has recently turned his attention to teaching startups a fundamental, little-discussed lesson that directly impacts their growth: how to scale. You’ll find not only incredible insights in every moment of every talk Dan gives - but also highly actionable takeaways that will propel your business forward. Because Dan gives freely of all that he knows. After all, you can only keep what you give away.

In fact, this is the same exact process that I used to raise over 57 million dollars for my startup, Vivino. First, I’ll show you how to start your pitch off the right way. Most startup pitches start with a long, boring intro. And in my experience, if you lose an investor in the first 30 seconds of your pitch deck, you’ve lost them for good. Next, you’ll see how to drill down into what your product does. This sounds simple… but it’s tricky for entrepreneurs to actually pull off. The third step of this startup pitch formula is to make sure you show investors that you’re worthy of venture capital. Fortunately, it’s not as hard as it sounds. In fact, there’s a process I use to make this step an absolute cinch. Next up, we have the complete startup pitch checklist. This ensures that you don’t leave anything out of your pitch that VCs want to see. Finally, you’ll learn how to create a sense of urgency in your pitch… and how to use slides that push investors to take action. In the end, you’ll learn how to pitch investors from someone that’s actually done it.

I’ll show you how private equity investing works and an app that opens this world up to everyone. I’ll then reveal three pre-IPO investments you can invest in right now including Elon Musk’s SpaceX! Those of you in the community know, this is where I got my start, as an analyst for venture capital and a part of the market most investors never see. This is where you see some of the best returns for investors. In a study comparing private equity returns across 2,100 funds against the MSCI world equity index, that pre-IPO private equity investing has beaten in every time period. Over the last 20 years, private equity investing has produced a 12% annual return, more than twice the return on the stock index. Private equity is investing in startups that aren’t ready to issue stock on the public markets so these companies go to firms like Google Ventures and Peter Thiel to get funding until they’re ready to IPO. Sometimes called angel investing, it’s this early-stage funding for new companies that helps helps the company grow to the point where it can sell shares in an IPO or attract a buyout from a larger company. 🤑 Get The Weekly Bow-Tie - my FREE weekly email newsletter sharing market updates, trends and the most important news!

By focusing outside of Silicon Valley and New York, Case has tapped into under-served entrepreneurs who are thriving in the heartland of America. This is a valuable show for aspiring start-ups as well as VC players. Best known as the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad—the #1 personal finance book of all time—Robert Kiyosaki has challenged and changed the way tens of millions of people around the world think about money. He is an entrepreneur, educator, and investor who believes that each of us has the power to makes changes in our lives, take control of our financial future, and live the rich life we deserve. With perspectives on money and investing that often contradict conventional wisdom, Robert has earned an international reputation for straight talk, irreverence, and courage and has become a passionate and outspoken advocate for financial education. Robert’s most recent books—Why the Rich Are Getting Richer and More Important Than Money—were published in the spring of this year to mark the 20th Anniversary of the 1997 release of Rich Dad Poor Dad. That book and its messages, viewed around the world as a classic in the personal finance arena, have stood the test of time. Why the Rich Are Getting Richer, released two decades after the international blockbuster bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad, is positioned as Rich Dad Graduate School.

The popular narrative of startups is outdated. You don't need venture capital to build a startup. You do need a DIY attitude, a lot of persistence and become a generalist who can learn new skills like coding, design and marketing quickly. This way of building a startup is called bootstrapping and it's the coolest way to do it I think. The best thing is you don't need to rub up to venture capitalists to get funding, you keep ownership of your company and you have higher odds to make more money.

If those early investors had held on to their entire stakes, and those stakes had never been diluted by later investors, they would be $3.5 billion today — a return of 70,000x! ***What is an Angel Investor?*** An individual who provides capital to an early stage company, usually the first outside investment to support the entrepreneur grow their business. This investment decision can be fueled by one of three main ways: 1) to support the entrepreneur, 2) solve the problem the business is solving, 3) make a financial return. Ideally all three of these come into play when making an angel investment. #Invest Startups #Investing #AngelInvesting Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/faresksebati/ 💸 Invest on Republic: http://republic.co/note/i/kiz47k 🚀 Raise Money For Your Startup on WeFunder: https://wefunder.com/faresksebati/raise-money 🏦 Other Platforms To Invest On: AngelList, SeedInvest, Wefunder, StartEngine 📲 DM me for help in raising $1M in a crowdfunding or Equity Crowdfunding Campaign! 🎥 RELATED VIDEOS 🎬 💸 How To Invest In Startups in 2020 (Pros and Cons): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdiWCgcqDGA 💰 How I Raised $600,000 Online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67HfCFSOa4U 🚀 10 Ways To Fund Your Startup Business: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD-vu2xK_zk 🏡 Inside Tour of My $67,500 Home Office: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5URnD_p7_c 💎 Why I Invested in Everydae: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iU96eEJkj4 💎 Why I Invested in Ternio BlockCard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTXMzfAWrP8 💎 Why I Invested in Rentberry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Em6p2RQYYg When I was 23 years old I had the idea for MySwimPro and today has grown to be one of the top technology and media companies in the fitness industry.

On the product side, you are essentially trying to find the perfect combination of audience, pain point, and solution. While marketing or sales are of course essential, you can hire the best marketing team with all the money in the world, and they still wouldn’t be able to make a flawed product succeed. We have over a 100 Forensics episodes to prove it. A customer hypothesis could be ‘first-time startup founders’, a problem hypothesis is that ‘they don’t know how to navigate fundraising’ - and a solution hypothesis could be an intensive accelerator program, or a Skillshare course, or a suite of SaaS tools that guide you through the steps.

The center-right and the country's traditional political class in general were wiped off the map. The former mayor of Medellin, Federico Gutierrez, or Fico, the center-right candidate who attracted the support of forces such as the U Party, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, Radical Change and the Democratic Center, did not even make it to the second round. Having the backing of Colombian political heavyweights such as Cesar Gaviria, Andres Pastrana and even Alvaro Uribe – not to mention President Ivan Duque himself – did him absolutely no good. Now, what could explain such an electoral turnaround in Colombia, and why have the center-right and Uribism received such a thrashing? And perhaps the biggest question of all: What is this all going to mean for Colombia?","tags":"VISUALPOLITIK, ENGLISH, petro, petro visualpolitik, colombia elections, elections in colombia, colombian president, latam politics, latin american politics, narcos in colombia, alvaro uribe, violence in colombia, rodolfo hernandez, gustavo petro, political shift in colombia","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R60e51xSBhg/hqdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB2isJA1JdU","title":"Colombia Is Rising Up","description":"Today marks one month of large-scale protests across Colombia, an uprising without a clear precedent in the South American country’s history.

According to human rights groups, more than 40 people have been killed by security forces, and the upheaval has turned into a genuine crisis of legitimacy for a historically unpopular government.

Left-wing populist Gustavo Petro is a former M-19 guerrilla running on a platform of income equality and environmentalism. His center-right opponent Rodolfo Hernandez is a wealthy businessman pushing an anti-corruption message, a different kind of populist who’s pledged to shrink the government and use the savings to pay off student debt. Whichever candidate wins, this election marks a major shift in Colombian politics, with meaningful long-term implications for the domestic economy as well as local and foreign investors.

Bars will be closed or will just not offer alcoholic drinks during that time. This is Colombia's way to make sure people take the election day serious and don't vote drunk or with a hangover. On top of that the metro and bus system is for free during the whole they, even the grin scooters sent me a message that they can be used to drive to the elections for free on that day.

Even three years after the peace treaty, there is no clear answer. The documentary charts the ongoing conflict between the FARC guerillas and government, which is still fueled by war and social inequality. Bogotá, 2016: the year that will go down in Colombian history books. After some five decades of civil war, the Marxist FARC guerrillas and the government signed a historic peace agreement before eyes of the world. It could have ended not only the armed conflict, but also the yawning gap between rich and poor in Colombia. A nationwide referendum at the beginning of October 2016 was supposed to give the government democratic legitimacy for the move and approval was considered certain. But then the unbelievable happened: The Colombian population rejected the agreement with the FARC rebels by a wafer-thin majority. It was a huge shock for the South American country, where the civil war had cost at least 220,000 lives and made six million people homeless. After nationwide student demonstrations, a new, revised peace treaty was finally signed in November 2016. Filmmaker Uli Stelzner followed the dramatic events of 2016 and the difficult process of implementing the agreement. Colombia may officially be at peace, but the country still knows no rest. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It's a crucial time for the country, with growing numbers of Colombians facing poverty, extreme income inequality, and a resurgence in cartel-related violence. The left has never won the presidency before in Colombia, a nation traditionally ruled by right-wing elites. The winner of this election will replace conservative president Ivan Duque, an unpopular leader who endured widespread protests against economic inequality last year. Petro is a senator, a former mayor of Bogota, and a former member of the armed group M-19. He has vowed tax increases, expansion of social programmes, and a progressive climate policy that would end new oil exploration. His campaign promises have rattled the business class, and both Petro and his environmental activist running mate Francia Marquez have seen their share of assassination threats. The surprise challenger to Petro is millionaire businessman and real estate tycoon Rodolfo Hernandez. Just in the past few weeks, social media has helped propel the popularity of the independent candidate.

Control Risks’ Silvana Amaya described this year’s election as being one full of “possibilities of change,” particularly as a response to recent social unrest, the drastic effects of the pandemic, among other major events affecting Colombia. Additionally, Amaya stressed the importance of having a strong and cohesive congress to ensure a proper system of checks and balances. On controlling risk, Amaya cited security is a primary concern, highlighting the possibility of cyberattacks and the need for resilient institutions to withstand these threats. XP Investments’ Alberto Bernal added that there was an additional component of uncertainty and skepticism generated by the COVID-19 pandemic which contributed to the pessimism and overall dynamic of this year’s election. Bernal projected that Colombia’s growth would be 6.5 percent in 2022, compared to 10.7 percent in 2021, which would signal a major outperformance of market projections. Renzo Merino from Moody’s Investors Service discussed Colombia’s fiscal reforms and cited the change of status of Moody’s credit rating for Colombia from negative to stable last October. Merino warned that future changes in Colombia’s fiscal policies could have effects on its credit ratings in the future, and suggested that, beyond Colombia’s fiscal reform, the country should look to attracting investments and focusing on pensions to improve Colombia’s economic outlook.

Son 27 enmiendas Un debate que se ha venido retomando en Colombia es el de volver al sistema federalista, o sea, donde las regiones tengan autonomía en el manejo de sus asuntos; así como la posibilidad de tener sus propias leyes, impuestos y políticas sociales y económicas. Colombia es un país muy diverso, dividido en 32 departamentos. El clima, la cultura, los recursos naturales, las preferencias políticas y las necesidades sociales pueden variar mucho de un departamento a otro. Por eso, la idea de adoptar un sistema federal es más que razonable. El gobierno central sería más débil, encargado de algunas funciones como la defensa nacional, las relaciones internacionales, la infraestructura de carácter nacional, las condiciones macroeconómicas y otros asuntos que entrarían a la discusión. Hay algunas preguntas a responder: ¿cuáles serían las ventajas de pasar de un modelo centralista a uno federalista? ¿Por qué no funcionó la experiencia en el pasado con el sistema federal? ¿Está condenado Colombia a ser un país con un modelo centralista?

Lo que empezó como una protesta contra una reforma tributaria ha derivado en una auténtico conflicto que ha dejado decenas de bajas civiles y otras tantas de la policía. El gobierno de Colombia, presidido por Iván Duque, ha tenido que retirar esta reforma fiscal. Sin embargo, las protestas continúan, esta vez para denunciar los excesos de las autoridades colombianas. Es evidente que Colombia es un país extremadamente violento. Los narcos, los grupos terroristas y los grupos paramilitares han obligado al estado a militarizar a su policía. Ahora Colombia tiene que modernizar sus fuerzas de seguridad. Pero eso es más complicado de lo que parece ¿Por qué Colombia tiene tanta oposición política a la modernización de su policía y su ejército? ¿Qué es la Doctrina Damasco? ¿Cuál es el problema de fondo en las protestas de Colombia?

Colombian congress will elect on March 13, Electoral observation mission warns of risks, Republic of Colombian president, how to avoid geopolitical tussles between major countries affecting bilateral ties? Colombian startup Ultra Air began flying in the South American country. Presidential elections in Colombia are held by direct popular vote every four years in April of even-numbered years. A plurality is sufficient to elect a president. Congressional elections also take place every four years. Beginning in 1978, they have been held two or three months prior to the presidential ballot and conducted in accordance with a system of proportional representation. Colombian political observers commonly viewed congressional and local government elections as primaries for the forthcoming presidential vote. The candidate whose supporters won the largest number of seats usually became the party's presidential nominee. Elections for the delegates to the departmental and municipal assemblies are held every two years. In presidential voting years, they are conducted shortly after the presidential elections. In nonpresidential voting years, they serve as mid-term elections (meticas). An electoral committee composed of two members from each party supervises the municipal ballot at each polling place. This committee reports the results to the municipal registrar's office, which then forwards them to the national registrar's office. The vote count is also overseen by a guarantee’s tribunal appointed by the president and consisting of the minister of government, the minister of communications, the national civic registrar, the national director of criminal rehabilitation, the director general of the National Police, and delegates from the political party leadership. #Colombia #Wikipedia #Venezuela #English #Europe #America #Live #News #colombian #bogota #Politics #Elections #US #Africa #russia #ukraine #canada #canadanews #canada_emergency","tags":"How does voting system work in Colombia, colombia, bogota, farc, Colombian Parliamentary election 2022, voting, voting system in Colombia, Presidential elections in Colombia, Electoral system, Latin America, Colombian president, Republic of Colombian president, how to avoid geopolitical tussles between major countries affecting bilateral ties?, Colombian startup Ultra Air began flying, voting system work in colombia, colombian startup ultra air, Election wing, Colombian Parliamentary","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OvptMEQXWRA/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hiOBBDxYu7Q","title":"Gustavo Petro, presidente electo de Colombia | El Tiempo","description":"Junio 19 del 2022 día histórico en Colombia, Gustavo Petro es el nuevo presidente de Colombia, el país lo eligió. #ElTiempo #EleccionesPresidenciales #ColombiaVota2022 SUSCRÍBETE: https://bit.ly/eltiempoYT Síguenos en nuestras redes sociales: Twitter: https://twitter.com/eltiempo Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eltiempo Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/eltiempo El Tiempo El Tiempo es el medio líder de noticias en Colombia, caracterizado por sus investigaciones y reportajes exclusivos, sobre: justicia, deportes, economía, política, cultura, tecnología, innovación, cambio climático, entre otros eventos noticiosos en Colombia y el mundo.

Duque was hand-picked by former right-wing President Álvaro Uribe and has vowed to roll back key parts of Colombia’s landmark peace deal with FARC rebels. Just before Duque’s inauguration, Democracy Now! spoke to Gustavo Petro, who placed second in this year’s presidential race, receiving 8 million votes in his attempt to become Colombia’s first leftist president. In the 1980s Petro was jailed and tortured for being a member of the M-19 guerrilla movement. He later went on to lead efforts in Colombia’s Congress to investigate ties between paramilitary death squads and top politicians.

You can listen to it with or without headphones or earphones. This range frequency is the most dominant during times of high mental activity. Stimulating beta brainwaves can lead to higher levels of concentration, improving learning ability and attention. To make it more effective, listen to it as a background when you're studying for at least 30 minutes a day. It is not possible to determine when it brings effects in a precise number of days. It is very subjective. This music works only if listened to in a waking state. You can play it as a background during study or job. For better effectiveness we recommend a moderate volume.

Uses beta wave tones to help you reach and maintain a high focus mental state. Use when working on advanced and complicated topics like mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any complex mental activity. Isochronic tones produce a stronger and more powerful brainwave entrainment effect, compared to binaural beats study music tracks or standard music. ► Subscribe to my channel and be updated with my latest tracks: http://www.youtube.com/user/MindAmend?sub_confirmation=1 What is this? This is a high-intensity audio brainwave entrainment session, using isochronic tones. Listen to this when you need a strong burst of intense focus to concentrate and study things like advanced mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any other complex mental activity. How is this session constructed? The session starts off beating at 10Hz and ramps up to 18Hz by the 6-minute mark. It stays at 18Hz until the final 5 minutes where it ramps back down again. How to use it? Listen to this track with your eyes open while doing the task/activity you want to focus on. Headphones are NOT required Although headphones are not required you may find they produce a more intense effect, because they help to block out distracting external sounds. When to listen? Because this track increases your beta brainwave activity, it's best to listen to this during the daytime and early evening. If you listen to this too close to bedtime, it might disrupt your sleep, in a similar way to how you might respond if you drank coffee just before going to bed. How loud should the volume be? The main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones, so you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them. But you also don't want it so loud that it's uncomfortable for you and hurts your ears, or gives you a headache. I'd recommend starting with the volume around halfway and adjust it to a level that you feel comfortable with from there. -------------------------------------------------------- Artist credit: Tomas Novoa Tracks: Arrecife, Ccenaga, Brotes, Prisma, Tundra --------------------------------------------------------","tags":"music for complex tasks, study music, peak focus for complex tasks, peak focus music, high focus music, increase focus, increase focus and concentration, increase focus and concentration music, concentration music, concentration music for work, concentration music for studying, brainwave entrainment, isochronic tones, binaural beats focus, binaural beats study, upbeat study music, binaural beats, increase concentration and focus meditation, deep focus","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wELOA2U7FPQ/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXZAbnn1kTU","title":"Ambient Study Music To Concentrate - 4 Hours of Music for Studying, Concentration and Memory","description":"Keep focused with this ambient study music to concentrate by Quiet Quest - Study Music.

Part of my peak focus for complex tasks isochronic tones series. A progressive house upbeat study music mix combined with beta wave isochronic tones and amplitude entrainment effects. Designed to produce a deep focus mental state while studying or working. ► Upbeat Study Music Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H12Fk08_2TQ\\u0026list=PLveg0IEcZWN7eQvidQOrkxiBvH0Skewwv ► Subscribe to my channel and be updated with my latest tracks: http://www.youtube.com/user/MindAmend?sub_confirmation=1 Use this track when working on advanced and complicated topics like coding/programming, mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any complex mental activity. Isochronic tones produce a stronger and more powerful brainwave entrainment effect when compared to binaural beats or standard music. What is this? This is a high-intensity audio brainwave entrainment session, using isochronic tones. Listen to this when you need a strong burst of intense focus to concentrate and study things like advanced mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any other complex mental activity. How is this session constructed? The session starts off beating at 10Hz and ramps up to the 18Hz range by the 6-minute mark. The isochronic tones frequency then randomly fluctuates between 17.5-18.5Hz to help prevent habituation. This stops you from getting too used to the same frequency when using the track regularly over time. Once the track gets to the final 5 minutes it ramps back down to 10Hz again. You can see an image showing how the session is constructed at the beginning of the video. How to use it? Listen to this track with your eyes open while doing the task/activity you want to focus on. Headphones are NOT required Although headphones are not required you may find they produce a more intense effect, because they help to block out distracting external sounds. When to listen? Because this track increases your beta brainwave activity, it's best to listen to this during the daytime and early evening. If you listen to this too close to bedtime, it might disrupt your sleep, in a similar way to how you might respond if you drank coffee just before going to bed. How loud should the volume be? The main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones, so you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them. But you also don't want it so loud that it's uncomfortable for you and hurts your ears, or gives you a headache. I'd recommend starting with the volume around halfway and adjust it to a level that you feel comfortable with from there.

Relaxation music can also be used as Spa music and Massage music. Here you can find powerful self-help hypnosis including healing music, Zen music and yoga music. Some sessions are produced for your inner transformation: to overcome fear, elevate your mood and energy levels, and lose weight faster. Meditation music recordings also include reiki music, Zen meditation music and deep trance hypnosis sessions. We compose instrumental and electronic music that is specially designed to enhance brain function and concentration, spa and massage therapy, and healing music therapy. For this reason, we use binaural beats. There are many types of beats for different daily meditation purposes: Delta Waves – Sleep Music / NREM sleep, Alpha Waves are neural oscillations, Theta Waves (Cortical theta rhythm and Hippocampal theta rhythm). Beta waves associated with muscle contractions in isotonic movements, Gamma waves can help to release serotonin, endorphin and dopamine, so it works as happiness music for depression treatment. * Sleep Music – Insomnia Music: Greenred Productions deep sleep music sessions have been specifically created to relax mind and body physically and mentally. Brainwave sessions are suitable for everyone including babies, children, and adults. Sleep hypnosis is based on beautifully slow, soft, soothing music to help you to fall asleep within minutes, naturally and without the aid of medication. These sleep meditation sessions will put you into relaxing healing sleep and will train your mind to fall asleep effortlessly. Relaxing sounds of nature combined with soothing music offers you a peaceful sleep. Would you like to learn to control your dreams, overcome nightmares? Lucid dream meditation sessions will help you to get into a deep state of relaxation and have a more pleasant sleep. Say no to sleep insomnia! Lucid Dreaming and Astral Travel music episodes are the most popular. * Study Music and Focus Music: Study Music \\u0026 Concentration Music is brainwave background music to help you to study, focus, and concentrate on learning process and work more effectively. Alpha Waves help your mind to get to the state of focus, which is perfect for studying or preparing for exam or test you have at school or university. It also maintains your alertness while studying. Beta waves will help to concentrate for tasks, enhance intelligence. - Google+ https://goo.gl/xTqwhX - FACEBOOK https://goo.gl/FfNFoa - Twitter https://goo.gl/BmEf8o - Our website https://goo.gl/SWuQNw","tags":"focus, concentration, binaural, music, focus music, concentration music, studying music, study music, super intelligence, music for focus, music for concentration, binaural beats, greenred productions, binaural beats focus, binaural beats concentration, focus binaural beats, binaural beats study, binaural music, beats, binaural focus, study binaural beats, music for studying, meditation music, binaural beats music, binaural beats for studying, focus beats, binural beats focus","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U0eLmyJkQBc/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOvJPh-I8HQ","title":"Deep Focus Music To Improve Concentration - 12 Hours of Ambient Study Music to Concentrate #290","description":"Deep Focus Music To Improve Concentration - 12 Hours of Ambient Study Music to Concentrate #289 Enjoy these 12 of deep focus music to improve concentration while studying with a beautiful selection of nature landscapes in the background.

The sonata is the first of only two Mozart piano sonatas in a minor key (the other being No. 14 in C minor, K. 457). It was composed in the summer of 1778 around the time of his mother's death, one of the most tragic times of his life. ------------------- Welcome to Just Instrumental Music!

This is a collection of almost all the piano music for studying to help concentration and focus I have written so far. The playlist include study music that I have composed since 2010-2014. This is 4 years in the making. As many of you know, I have also been in medical school for the last 4 years as well. Thus, as I listen to this playlist, I see my experiences, studies, cramming time, tests and exam anxieties, all-nighters, etc. all flash before my eyes. For those of you who have been following me through this journey and have kept up with this channel, I would love to hear stories of what these pieces trigger in your memories. Thank you for those who have been with me on this incredible ride of music and medicine. I hope that my music has helped you focus, concentrate, or even relax and sleep. If it has benefited you in anyway, then I would consider my efforts worth while. And also for those who have inquired about sheet music, I do not have any. Many of these songs were recorded in the midst of my medical school obligations and studies. I barely had enough time to release them. I'm really sorry! Thank you once again for your support in every way. Please share this with anyone who you think may need this in any capacity, whether it be studying, concentrating, help focusing and beating distractons, relaxing, drinking coffee, or even sleeping/ battling with insomnia. It is because of you guys- the students, scholars, teachers, professors, mothers, fathers, parents, professors, future doctors, lawyers, and engineers that makes the Study Music Project meaningful.

This music for studying is focus music composed to boost your brain. Our study music or brain music has been embedded with binaural beats to help your focus more easily. Yellow Brick Cinema’s study music is particularly helpful to improve concentration. Studying requires you to work with prolonged concentration and so our music to study and concentrate helps shift your attention away from what’s going on around you so you can focus on your work. Our concentration music is instrumental music that helps stop your mind from wandering, thus increasing the impact of your study sessions. The effect of our studying music on increasing attention span, leads people to refer to our focus music as brain music or intelligence music. Yellow Brick Cinema’s studying music can be used as meditation music to help bring focus to your mind. One of the most effective ways to boost concentration is to start a study session with a short meditation practice.

Beta wave tones to help you reach and maintain a high focus mental state. Use this track when working on advanced and complicated topics like mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any complex mental activity. Isochronic tones produce a stronger and more powerful brainwave entrainment effect, compared to binaural beats study music tracks or standard music. ► Subscribe to my channel and be updated with my latest tracks: http://www.youtube.com/user/MindAmend?sub_confirmation=1 What is this? This is a high-intensity audio brainwave entrainment session, using isochronic tones. Listen to this when you need a strong burst of intense focus to concentrate and study things like advanced mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any other complex mental activity. How is this session constructed? The session starts off beating at 10Hz and ramps up to 18Hz by the 6-minute mark. It stays at 18Hz until the final 5 minutes where it ramps back down again. How to use it? Listen to this track with your eyes open while doing the task/activity you want to focus on. Headphones are NOT required Although headphones are not required you may find they produce a more intense effect, because they help to block out distracting external sounds. When to listen? Because this track increases your beta brainwave activity, it's best to listen to this during the daytime and early evening. If you listen to this too close to bedtime, it might disrupt your sleep, in a similar way to how you might respond if you drank coffee just before going to bed. How loud should the volume be? The main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones, so you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them. But you also don't want it so loud that it's uncomfortable for you and hurts your ears, or gives you a headache. I'd recommend starting with the volume around halfway and adjust it to a level that you feel comfortable with from there. #upbeatstudymusic #studymusic #focusmusic --- Artist credit: Mintz, from the album Butterflies.

It is really not that hard or that expensive to be really well-dressed. There are, in fact, basic hallmarks of a well-dressed gentleman that anyone can follow. Shop Hanger Project: https://www.kirbyallison.com PRODUCTS FEATURED IN VIDEO Wellington Shoe Laces https://www.kirbyallison.com/catalogsearch/result/?cat=0\\u0026q=laces Collar Stays https://www.kirbyallison.com/clothing-accessories/luxury-collar-stays-and-collar-stay-holders.html Ties https://www.kirbyallison.com/clothing-accessories/neckware.html Pocket Squares https://www.kirbyallison.com/clothing-accessories/pockect-squares.html 1. Good Hygiene. Looking really good and being a gentleman always starts with pride in yourself. And that always begins with one’s personal hygiene. The initial hallmark of being a well-dressed gentleman is always good hygiene. Once your personal cleanliness is taken care of, you can focus on your personal ensemble for the day. 2. Clean, unstained, well-mended clothes. They don't have to be new -- but they can't be ripped, stained, and threadbare. You also don’t have to wear a new, freshly laundered shirt every day, but it does have to be pressed. But if it sinks or has any visible stains, wear a fresh one. 3. Well-Pressed. Now that your clothes are clean, they also need to well-pressed, with a crisp trouser crease and freshly-pressed dress shirt are essential. 4. Properly-Fitting. Your dress shirt, jacket, and trousers need to fit properly. And always better a little loose than a little tight. It always looks bad if your clothes are too tight or too small. But clothes that are a little large can have their own look. Just like Anderson \\u0026 Shepphard -- their jackets are a little large to create drape, and people think they are amazing. If you are not comfortable in a suit, it doesn't fit. I'm telling you, the most comfortable clothing a man can wear is a dress ensemble. A properly-fitting wool suit where the fabric is matched to the climate, a dress shirt whose collar fits properly, and tie is absolutely the most comfortable clothing a man can wear. If it isn't, it doesn't fit. That is a fact. 5. Well-Polished Dress Shoes Well-polished shoes with unfrayed fray laces absolutely make difference in being well-dressed. This has been proven study after study. Both men and women notice the condition of a man’s shoes right away. Not only with well-polished shoes make you look better, but they’ll make your shoes last longer. A little bit of effort, some Saphir shoe polish, and our Hanger Project High-Shine Chamois is all you need. Of course, we have an extensive library of shoe care tutorials to help you learn how to properly care for and polish your shoes. 6. Pocket Square You can never go wrong with a white pocket square; however; matching your pocket square to your ensemble in a neutral or complementary color is always a good idea. However, never exactly match your pockets square to your tie in the same silk. 7. Nice Tie with a Proper Dimple Most ties look best with a dimple. And most ties look good with their ends relatively close to each other. 8. A nice Fragrance. It is always nice to top off a beautiful ensemble with a little bit of a nice cologne so that you smell as good as you look. It doesn’t have to be an expensive fragrance, but it does have to smell good. Just be careful to not use too much so that it is not overpowering. The only way you can go wrong with fragrance is if you use way too much. For a large part of the day, people will be put off because you smell way too strong. But, in general, some cologne is a good idea. If you are preparing for anything important, you start by taking care of yourself. You take a nice hot shower, you shave, you trim your nose and ears, and eyebrows if necessary. You put on a little cologne. Shine your shoes, press any garments that need to be touched up, and then dress well. This doesn’t have to be difficult, time-consuming, or expensive – instead, it can be a ritual you enjoy and to which you look forward.

Dressing Tips - Do&#39;s &amp; Don&#39;ts for chubby women","description":"Uncertain of what to wear over your chubby and curvy body? Don't you worry anymore, as our very own fashion designer and plus size model Akshaya talks about appropriate plus size clothing that you can try on \\u0026 look slim. Every woman has unique body shape and there is no need to feel inferior about it. She explains how one can dress up according to distribution of weight in their body. Don't bother about bulging tummy or thunder thighs. Just watch this video and look nice! In this video, Akshaya tells us the Do's and Don'ts for chubby girls, plus size women, and dressing tips for such women. She elaborates how knowing your body shape helps your dressing, how top heavy women should try using a coat to cover up, what kinds of neck cuts to wear or not to wear depending on your body type. Additionally, she also tells us how showing or not showing the belly or calf has an effect on your appearance and how A-line full frilled frocks below the bust, or panels in the frilled frocks make you look slimmer. She goes on to tell how evening gowns can be used as an alternative to sarees and ghaghra choli for ethnic functions like sangeeth and how close necks or step necks alter your appearance. She also outlines the choice of colours for dark and fair complexioned plus sized women and how a distracting neckpiece can take the attention away from your heavy waistline. We also get to know the types of body shapes - pear shape, hourglass and the suitable choice of sleeves or sleeveless dresses based on a body type.

On top, try a white button-up for summer or a stylish sweater for winter. To wear a smart casual dress, opt for a classic style, such as a shirt or wrap design, in a neutral colour. A healthy mind and body does not stop at being sane and disease- free. Being healthy also means feeling great and comfortable all day long. One of the basic ways to ensure a fresh feeling every day is to maintain a good personal hygiene. | Naya TV, like, share and comment #smartdressing, #style, #fashion, #womensfashion, #classy, #dapper, #suit, #classywomen, #womenstyle, #womenslaw, #clothing, #dapperstyle, #suitandtie #dandystyle, #shirtandtie, #tiegamestrong, #tie, #shirt, #suits, #mints, #suitstyle, #sanitizer, #hygiene, #nayatv Cloths | Women Cloths | Fashion | Hygiene | Classy | Personal Hygiene | Female Hygiene | Smart | Smart Dressing | Clothing | Suit | Style | Lady Style | Sanitizer | Mouth-Freshener | Mint | Healthy Food","tags":"#smartdressing, #style, #fashion, #womensfashion, #classy, #dapper, #suit, #classywomen, #womenstyle, #womenslaw, #clothing, #dapperstyle, #suitandtie #dandystyle, #shirtandtie, #tiegamestrong, #tie, #shirt, #suits, #mints, #suitstyle, #sanitizer, #hygiene, #nayatv","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Z4-1ttaQS4/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LdwEpxKrGMU","title":"skinny girl dressing tips #shorts #short #elitetrendyfashion","description":"Hello everyone Welcome to my Channel ELITE TRENDY FASHION https://bit.ly/3hS9CtA.

These technologies are making militaries faster, smarter, more efficient. But if unchecked, they threaten to destabilize the world. DW takes a deep dive into the future of conflict, uncovering an even more volatile world. Where a cyber intrusion against a nuclear early warning system can unleash a terrifying spiral of escalation; where “flash wars” can erupt from autonomous weapons interacting so fast that no human could keep up. Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tells DW that we have already entered the technological arms race that is propelling us towards this future. “We’re right in the middle of it. That’s the reality we have to deal with.” And yet the world is failing to meet the challenge. Talks on controlling autonomous weapons have repeatedly been stalled by major powers seeking to carve out their own advantage. And cyber conflict has become not just a fear of the future but a permanent state of affairs. DW finds out what must happen to steer the world in a safer direction, with leading voices from the fields of politics, diplomacy, intelligence, academia, and activism speaking out.

In this video we’ll explore the world’s fastest improving new solar technology, and provide an exclusive peek inside the lab of a team working on this breakthrough material. Imagine an inexpensive solution of perovskite crystals that can make a photovoltaic cell so thin, that just half a cup of liquid would be enough to power a house. A solar panel so lightweight, that it can be balanced atop a soap bubble. That is known as the holy grail of solar energy. So when will we see perovskite solar panels used for a solar power system for your home? Maybe sooner than you expect. Currently, only 2% of global electricity comes from solar power. And 90% of that, comes from crystalline silicon-based solar panels, the dominant material technology. While abundant, silicon has downsides related to efficiency, manufacturing complexity, and pollution that prevent it from being an absolute no brainer. Emerging thin films like perovskites present a bright future. Imagine solar cars like a solar tesla, solar yachts, or a solar plane. Solar cell technologies can be classified into two categories, wafer-based or thin-film cells. Perovskites are the leading contender in emerging thin films. Topics covered in this video include applications, perovskite crystal structure, working principle of perovskite solar cells, efficiency limits, multi-junction solar cells, shockley-queisser limit, how solar works, solar simulator, band gap, manufacturing, vapor deposition, how solar panels are made, and the future of solar power.

It is projected to achieve 45 percent higher performance, or 75 percent lower energy use, than today's most advanced 7 nm node chipsi. The potential benefits of these advanced 2 nm chips could include: Quadrupling cell phone battery life, only requiring users to charge their devices every four daysii. Slashing the carbon footprint of data centers, which account for one percent of global energy useiii. Changing all of their servers to 2 nm-based processors could potentially reduce that number significantly. Drastically speeding up a laptop's functions, ranging from quicker processing in applications, to assisting in language translation more easily, to faster internet access.

The world's funkiest tech and travel show hits Sweden. Tune in as host, Ashlee Vance, travels from Stockholm to Luleå, discovering how the Swedes got so good at making the things the whole world loves. His journey includes: a conversation with a face-swapping robot, fika with Spotify's Daniel Ek, and a look at how efficient energy is reimagining data centers and turbine power. Tucked away down a side street in Östermalm, Stockholm’s ultra-hip neighborhood, is Café Saturnus. The place reeks of style and expensive lattes. Handsome waiters with spectacular man buns serve up delicious meals, while elegant patrons relax inside the colorful shop or take in the city scene sitting at wooden tables outside. Daniel Ek, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Spotify, is there all the time, and it’s easy enough to find him catching a quick breakfast. Ek comes from a generation of Swedes that were fed a steady diet of technology in their youth. Decades ago, the Swedish government concluded that technology would be a big part of the country’s future, so it set out to build high-speed Internet lines for all, to subsidize PC purchases, and to teach computer science at schools. The results have been phenomenal. Sweden has produced an outsized stream of mega consumer-technology hits—Spotify, Minecraft and Candy Crush—while also building an infrastructure capable of supporting some of the world’s largest data centers. Though tiny in terms of population, Sweden has emerged as Europe’s premiere technology powerhouse. This episode of Hello World takes a look at Sweden’s success and examines how the country’s culture is coping with the sudden influx of tech riches. I start out in Stockholm eating cinnamon buns with Ek at Café Saturnus, discussing his background, struggles, and aspirations. From there, I meet with the founders of startups such as Furhat Robotics, which is rethinking how people and machines interact, and I hang out with other young, ambitious technophiles who chill at the local nerd lounge, Epicenter. Along the way, there are encounters with Swedish meatballs, Swedish whiskey, and Swedish hangovers. I head from Stockholm to the picturesque town of Luleå. It’s there—right on the cusp of the Arctic Circle—that Facebook has built what’s believed to be the world’s most efficient data center. It’s an engineering marvel designed to cool tens of thousands of like machines with Arctic air. The systems run on hydroelectric power pumped out by turbines planted along the Lule River. Naturally, I decide to go inside some of these turbines and turn them on, all while in the company of a pair of amiable moose hunters. The Swedes’ mastery of technology has roots in the country’s culture. These are the people that brought us Ikea, Hu0026M, and Björn Borg underwear. They have a natural sense of clean, functional design that carries over to such services as Spotify and Minecraft. There’s also a real desire to be forward-thinking while still living in harmony with nature. And so Vattenfall—the local energy giant—can build its dams along the Lule River and provide all the power Northern Sweden needs, just as long as it agrees to restock the river with millions of fish to maintain some measure of balance with the surroundings. But then comes the turmoil. Sweden hasn’t quite figured out how to digest people such as Ek and Minecraft creator Markus Persson and the services they’ve created. Swedes generally prefer to go about their business without drawing too much attention. The only time they brag is to convey just how humble they really are. Yet it’s difficult to keep this act up when you’re making millions—sometimes billions—of dollars. Ek went through a period of soaking himself in champagne at Swedish nightclubs and driving fast cars, and Persson followed with his own journey into personal excess. Both men came away unfulfilled and haunted by their new fame and riches. While they’re the top of the pyramid, plenty of Swedes have made small fortunes and the country as a whole is struggling to come to terms with its changing identity as the home of tech playboys.

The sand stores the heat at around 500C, which can then warm homes in winter when energy is more expensive.

The secret to this type of exponential success? Bin your ‘affirmations’ and ‘goals’ and instead embrace fear as your friend by making irreversible decisions. Instead of hapless resolutions members of the \"Lock-In\" cult contract with themselves in a way that they cannot escape from (without suffering brutal consequences). The “Lock-In\" system harnesses our most primal evolutionary instinct - to avoid pain - and uses it to radically supercharge our lives. Many of the most successful people in history have used its phenomenal power to create extraordinary success. Think you're hardcore enough? Then enter the Cult of Extreme Productivity Mark Adams is Vice President and Head of Innovation at VICE, which has come from humble beginnings as a print magazine to digitally transform into a 5 billion dollar youth media empire. In this talk, Mark describes the cult of extreme productivity that he became part of alongside his brother. The cult is all about making irreversible decisions that make “manifesting” your dreams the only option because not achieving it would create indescribable suffering.

Sci-fi's power is in taking you to another world, and thus its music must reflect that. If done right, the mix of typically larger-than-life movie sonics is combined with unique textures and tones of explorative sound design, creating an aurally stunning experience. It's quite broad in terms of tropes, but sticking to terms that are associated with the style we can recall theremin, synthesizer, Sliding Synth sound, echo. Sounds found on an atmospheric soundtrack may use instruments that are soothing, emotive, minimalist, epic, and unobtrusive.r r Electronic music in film arguably began with the use of the theremin, as exemplified in the classic extraterrestrial visitation film The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). In Bernard Herrmann’s score, the instrument is set atop a largely orchestral score typical of the era, with a wide vibrato that, at times, makes the sound difficult to distinguish from an open-vowel vocal from a soprano opera singer.r r One of the more obtuse but interesting uses of technology in sci-fi film is how quickly we adopted synthesized sounds into our vision of the future since they represent the obvious sound of the future. Still, the use of the instrument begat our fascination with representing the otherworldly (i.e., aliens, UFOs, and other extraterrestrial concepts) with markedly otherworldly sounds.r r One of the ways sci-fi scores have kept pace with film scoring at large is in the increasing use of ethnic percussion and instrumentation over the past decade.r r Today, of course, synths pervade much of film’s sonic landscape, though frequently still in tandem with classical, romantic orchestral writing.r r For this volume of the concentration Sci-Fi Chillstep playlist, we have made a selection of music steeped in the dark atmosphere of the future. It is primarily designed for productive and enjoyable coding. Captivating space music in this mix will be helpful during the programming session, as well as any other kind of work. Tune in, let our cyber mix help you through a difficult day, and enjoy the music. 📷 Image author Devon Fay https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6ddRn Learn how to create 3d detailed environment with the image author Devon Fay https://www.thegnomonworkshop.com/tutorials/creating-a-sci-fi-alleyway  We have created a new channel and we really need your help. 🙏 Please like, comment or subscribe. r r Genre: Electronic music Style: Chillstep, Future Garage Mood: Lonely, Night, Future, Cyber Duration: One Hour Feature: Without Lyrics, No vocals r 📹 Similar videosr All Music VIdeos ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkemG2q7FaIGsQCcCHieasOEr Work Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkc6L7Bgqzz_Q7q2JN2AqHV3r Chillout Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkeSTmryNClNxUkioFpq3Btxr Study Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkcx8_AcwRjTPiYSauQTQeNir Programming Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkfAWkk7-Clm18krBuziKQfrr Ambient Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBketYRDDb8lheUOD4q7U27DRr Chillstep Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkeH0adsnxZupMARfGxY6qikr Chillhop Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkdmK1rCN4D-GO9g79QXqdVdr Lo-Fi Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkcywzGlsZ9c6aerJr3tK058r Contemporary Classic ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkdg39l-YqG9eXanlNBiSgzfr r 🎧 Tracklistr ► 00:00 4lienetic - Eunoia ► 05:44 Aeon Waves - Stay ► 11:11 Blaudiss - Cannot Be Undone ► 14:34 Almost Vanished - Silentium ► 19:58 Himalia - Growing Upwards ► 26:31 Anfield - Belong ► 30:59 4lienetic, Solace, Cash - Eloigne ► 35:03 CMP - Those Days ► 38:49 Moon - Do Not Look Back ► 42:18 Cheprox - Breathe ► 45:37 Konara - Promise Kept ► 48:37 Airlines - Aloft ► 53:41 Panda Coast - Dusk ► 58:45 Lazarus Moment - Piece Of You ► 1:04:42 Dawncall - Dive ► 1:07:12 Aether, Enzalla - Elysias Heart ► 1:10:50 Alivvve - Eternity ► 1:14:43 AK - Goner r r r r #DeepWorkMusic #DarkCodingMusic #SciFiChillstep", "tags": "сhillstep playlist, sci-fi music, programming music, coding music for programmers, coding music, robot music, droid music, music for working, cyber music, future music, dark background music, dark playlist, music for creating, space music, dark chillstep music, future garage, dark minds, calm minds, robot sounds music, calm dark music, vangelis inspiration", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4MpzSMkinw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFbi70Td8xI", "title": "productivity desk setup 2022", "description": "lemme know if you got any questions 😳", "tags": "productivity desk tour, workspace setup, workspace tour, productive workspace, productive desk setup, desk tour 2021, desk setup 2021, productivity desk 2021, productivity desk 2020, productivity room, room tour, home office setup, desk tour, desk setup, james scholz, work from home, study space, productive, aesthetic, tools for students, beautiful desk, desk, desk layout, work from home setup, study with me, studyspo, study motivation, minimal desk setup, computer science", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gFbi70Td8xI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M6bIeVbCqA", "title": "My Simple Productivity System (for normal people)!", "description": "🧑🏻‍💻 I love watching productivity videos and implementing tips from Tiago Forte, Ali Abdaal, and Thomas Frank but I’ll be the first to admit it’s too hard to adhere to their productivity systems 100% 🥲 So, I came up with my own simple productivity system that provides 80% of the benefit with just 20% of the effort: 1️⃣ Step 1 - Capture 2️⃣ Step 2 - Organize The biggest pro tip comes from Tiago Forte: The wrong way is to organize by where you found the information, the right way is to organize by where that information will be used!

As it comes out of the box, your phone is a big distraction — it’s flashy, beautiful and makes a lot of noises that ensure your eyes stay glued to the screen. It’s created to make sure you’re using it as much as possible and everything is placed in a smart way to ensure you become almost a slave to it. However, we now have several tools at our disposal to invert this trend and make our phone a tool that is actually helpful to foster a productive and healthy lifestyle instead of an obsessive one. This video is all about that — 20 things you can change and configure in your phone to regain control. So let’s get started.

Just like you, they put things off, they delayed, they made excuses, they hoped deadlines would never come due. This caused them anxiety, it pissed their colleagues and families off, it created problems and most of all it wasted time. Twenty centuries ago, the Roman era Stoic philosopher Seneca joked that the one thing fools all have in common is that they are always getting ready to live. But they never do it.

Click here for more info: https://www.projectelon.com/theproductivityalgorithm I've been making YouTube videos for 6 years, but the single biggest gripe I have is the vast majority of my subscribers watch a video, but they don't actually take ACTION. When you watch a video, you’re sitting in a passive state. How many of you have watched a YouTube video and thought, this is amazing. This content will change my life. And you get excited about it - but then you move on to the next video and you never do a thing about it? Watching YouTube, reading books, even paying $10,000’s to attend lectures at university - you’re learning in a passive state. But how much will you actually remember?” Because knowledge is not power. Knowledge is potential power. Knowledge is only useful if it is followed by action. If you really want to significantly improve your productivity and drastically change the way you live your life, you need to take action. That's exactly what The Productivity Algorithm is all about - taking massive action. We have live workshops every day where myself and two assistant instructors will be walking you through the day's module, 6 hours of lecture videos, exercises, workbooks, quizzes, a private Slack community, free access to the Transform Your Grades course we launched in March 2021 on top of several other bonuses. The Productivity Algorithm is an accumulation of 6 years of experimenting, researching, coaching, teaching, and creating content that has been viewed by millions of people all over the world. For cohort 1, I want to keep the workshops relatively small therefore I only have 60 slots available. I can also guarantee that I'm never going to price a future cohort this low again.

In this talk, he argues that productivity doesn't have to feel cold and corporate—and that it’s possible to get more done every day without hating the process. Drawing from a decade's worth of research, as well as his yearlong productivity project, Chris argues that the best way to become more productive is to manage our time, attention, and energy better. In addition to sharing this more human approach to productivity, Chris concludes by providing 5 practical ways we can all get more done every day. Chris has experimented with every productivity technique under the sun including what it’s like to live like a caveman! His latest book \"The Productivity Project\" is based on his innovative research and underlines the claim that Chris \"\"might be the most productive man you’d ever hope to meet” (TED talks).r r When Chris graduated University, he received two full-time job offers, but decided to decline them both to dedicate a full year of his life to exploring his passion: productivity. Over the past decade his experimentation continued and his work has received national and international media attention from The New York Times, Fortune, Fast Company, Lifehacker, New York Magazine, and countless others. Every month his work is read by about 200,000 people from almost every country around the world. You can view Chris’s work at ALifeofProductivity.com. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Microsoft Productivity Score is a tool that gives you one place for end-to-end visibility-- including insights, peer benchmarks, and actions that you can take to help your people be more productive using the technologies and services in Microsoft 365. It's designed for anyone focused on technology adoption for their organization. You'll find Productivity Score in the Reports section of the Microsoft 365 admin center. Anyone with report reader role or higher privileges can access Productivity Score. Here you can see your score on a percentage scale and as in the Score Breakdown, it comprises both the People Experiences and Technology Experiences. People Experiences include the measures for how the organization is working and Technology Experiences helps you understand how technology can better assist you in optimizing productivity. In Productivity Score, we show where you are today, the trend over the last six months, and how you compare to peers in your industry. Looking at each category you'll find: - Communication – so you see what modes people are using to communicate; - Meetings – to see whether your online meetings follow best practices; - Content Collaboration – to see how well people are working together using online files; - Teamwork – to measure whether your people are working together using shared workspaces such as Teams; - Mobility - to show you how your people are using their devices to work flexibly wherever they are, - Endpoint Analytics - to look at how device hardware and software contribute to productivity; - Microsoft 365 Apps health - to see if your Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook are up-to-date and on supported servicing channels; and finally - Network Connectivity - with tailored insights and actions to help improve connections to Microsoft cloud services  ► LINK REFERENCES: To get your productivity score and get started, go to https://aka.ms/productivityscore For related resources, check out https://aka.ms/prodscoreresources For more details on the time savings presented and cited in Microsoft Productivity Score, see https://aka.ms/M365TEIstudy To see what's coming soon to Endpoint Analytics with Brad Anderson, see https://aka.ms/EndpointAnalyticsUpdates Unfamiliar with Microsoft Mechanics?

Click here for more info: https://www.projectelon.com/theproductivityalgorithm I've been making YouTube videos for 6 years, but the single biggest gripe I have is the vast majority of my subscribers watch a video, but they don't actually take ACTION. When you watch a video, you’re sitting in a passive state. How many of you have watched a YouTube video and thought, this is amazing. This content will change my life. And you get excited about it - but then you move on to the next video and you never do a thing about it? Watching YouTube, reading books, even paying $10,000’s to attend lectures at university - you’re learning in a passive state. But how much will you actually remember?” Because knowledge is not power. Knowledge is potential power. Knowledge is only useful if it is followed by action. If you really want to significantly improve your productivity and drastically change the way you live your life, you need to take action. That's exactly what The Productivity Algorithm is all about - taking massive action. We have live workshops every day where myself and two assistant instructors will be walking you through the day's module, 6 hours of lecture videos, exercises, workbooks, quizzes, a private Slack community, free access to the Transform Your Grades course we launched in March 2021 on top of several other bonuses. The Productivity Algorithm is an accumulation of 6 years of experimenting, researching, coaching, teaching, and creating content that has been viewed by millions of people all over the world. For cohort 1, I want to keep the workshops relatively small therefore I only have 60 slots available. I can also guarantee that I'm never going to price a future cohort this low again.

It's refreshing to see a slate Samsung phone deliver a unique vibe. This isn't an \"average\" all rounder phone. This is built with purpose and for a specific kind of user. If it waddles like a Note, and quacks like a Note, and S-pens like a Note, then it's a Note. This phone is a Note, and I love it.

With everything going on, I agree that there are far more important things than “productivity.” Over the years, I feel that this specific term has gotten a bad rap with the glorification of hustle culture and people putting in insane hours to achieve whatever it is that they want it to achieve. That said, I do believe there's a difference between mindfully putting in the hours to work towards a specific vision that you’ve set and created for yourself vs mindlessly and blindly working for the sake of working. While researching for this video I came across this quote that beautifully summarized my thoughts: “Most people are living at such a furious pace that they rarely stop to ask themselves what they stand for and who they want to be. As a consequence, they let external demands dictate their actions.” —Tony Schwartz (https://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time) I hope we can all work smarter not harder *so that* we can carve out time for what is truly essential. Time spent cherishing ourselves. Time spent with people who matter most to us. Time spent meditating on life, our existence, the meaning of our existence. Time spent unplugged, somewhere, anywhere so long as we’re fully present. There are many, many things we often overlook due to the busyness of life, and I hope we can all spend more time on what is essential, and less on what is not. 🌿💚✨ Sending my love always~ ••• 📒 Articles mentioned ╰ James Clear’s Habit Scorecard https://jamesclear.com/habits-scorecard ╰ Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time by Tony Schwartz https://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time ╰ Productivity Isn’t About Time Management, It’s About Attention Management by Adam Grant https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/smarter-living/productivity-isnt-about-time-management-its-about-attention-management.html 📚 Books mentioned ╰ Smarter Faster Better by Charles Duhigg https://amzn.to/2KMVe6H ╰ Atomic Habits by James Clear https://amzn.to/2XdLATx ╰ Essentialism by Greg McKeown https://amzn.to/30P9pzA ╰ The Great CEO Within by Matt Mochary https://amzn.to/31RZnP8 📝 Timestamps 📝 0:00 Intro 1:21 Managing time vs energy 3:10 What is an energy audit? 3:39 How to energy audit: IDENTIFY 7:03 How to energy audit: UNDERSTAND 8:03 How to energy audit: CHOOSE 9:38 How to energy audit: REPLENISH 11:47 Key takeaway u0026 next steps 13:26 Thank you Audible! ••• ✨ If you’re at all curious ✨ ➫ My spiritual practice, Falun Dafa http://bit.ly/2z49zqz ➫ If you're interested in reading more, start with this to get an understanding of what qigong entails http://bit.ly/2u8DXOC ➫ The main text we read is Zhuan Falun* http://bit.ly/2t48xJP *Best to read start to finish in the shortest time possible for the highest benefit. ➫ If you want to learn more about Falun Dafa and qigong, check out local contacts in your area - there are practitioners globally and in most big enough-ish cities: http://bit.ly/2E0PL6S ➫ My friend Chris over at China Uncensored made an incredibly informative video on what Falun Dafa is and why it's being persecuted in China (YT video): http://bit.ly/2CR9yZQ ••• OUR NEW JEWELRY LINE w/ Ana Luisa: https://www.analuisa.com/collections/beauty-within/ I'm wearing Caricake's necklace: https://www.analuisa.com/products/cari-necklace 🛍 Ebates: Get paid to shop (up to 20%+ cash back) https://ebates.com/r/ROOWEN4 🏡 AirBnB: Get $40 travel credit https://airbnb.com/c/rtsai21 ••• Music: http://share.epidemicsound.com/V39z8 🎥 Equipment ╰ Camera: https://amzn.to/315WxqL ╰ Tripod: http://amzn.to/2sPRaIu ╰ Mic: https://amzn.to/2ZetpeH ╰ Edit: Final Cut Pro X", "tags": "self care, self love, productivity, rowenatsai, wellness, how to get your life together, self care routine, pamper routine, sunday routine", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gDgk7rsy2Ik/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZvWrUXhWY", "title": "How I Consistently Study with a Full Time Job: My Scheduling Formula", "description": "👩‍🦰 http://curiositystream.com/elizabethfilips will get you 26% off the Annual Plan for Curiosity Stream - that's $11.59 a year 😉 I've gone from loving calendars to hating calendars, to loving calendars again, and along this journey of trying to manage my time, organise myself and try to balance studying and working, I've gathered a few tips on scheduling.

While she was finishing up her high school career Carlin realized she had been so busy, she had no idea how she ever had time to have a little fun or truly give her full attention to everything that she was involved in. Carlin’s talk is about just that: being busy versus being productive. Carlin is a freshman at Nebraska Wesleyan University. While she was finishing up her high school career she realized had been so busy, she had no idea how she ever had time to have a little fun or truly give her full attention to everything that she was involved in. About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)", "tags": "United States, ted talk, TEDxTalks, ted, ted talks, tedx talk, tedx, tedx talks, Lifestyle, Culture, English, ted x, Life", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jd3_J-J6fsc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFSZYGyQBL4", "title": "WEEKLY VLOG - finding a gym routine, productivity + feeling good!!!", "description": "Open Down Here!

Flying as an airline pilot for the past 12 years, Joe has learned first-hand how powerful checklists are in an aircraft cockpit environment. Overtime he implemented more and more self-made checklists in his everyday life, increasing his productivity, discipline, focus and ultimately achieved more success. What works for a million flights every day, must work in your everyday life! With his talk, he wants to share his methods on how to set up your own checklist for success, every day! This talk is part of a TEDx Vaduz, „be small, THINK BIG“ which took place in Vaduz/Liechtenstein on the 21.08.2021.

A lovely flight attendant would then pick me up and take care of me during my flight right until my grandparents or my godfather picked me up at the arrivals gate at London Heathrow. At that time, my godfather used to work for London radar as an air traffic controller and that enabled me to witness a Boeing 747 or Concorde take-off, near the runways of Heathrow. Once the Concorde was airborne and the vibrating ground had calmed, I said to myself: \"This is what I want to do for a living!\" My goal is to become a motivational speaker and share the knowledge from my experience as a pilot with my audience and how they can apply procedures/checklists pilots use in the cockpit to their everyday life! This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The increasing popularity and widespread use of the pomodoro technique is no coincidence - it truly works. In this video, I go over 1. Brief history and theory of the Pomodoro Technique 2.

But before I show you this simple productivity hack, I have to tell you that UNDERNEATH this trait is the desire to BUILD SOMETHING FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND US. Like our family, or our future generations, or even the world. So, keep that in mind because when you see this video, you might mistakenly think I’m telling you it’s not important to do those things, but in reality, it’s ALL ABOUT building things for yourself AND those you love. Because the single productivity trait that has driven the majority of success and productivity in my life, and in the lives of other people in my circle, is our ability to limit or to avoid most forms of entertainment. Watch this video to see exactly how to do this because it’s a very important aspect to UNDERSTAND, and one that’s easy to MISUNDERSTAND.

In this instance of the multiverse, he is not a big fan of rock and heavy metal music but rather prefers dark and futuristic wave beats which are helping him to concentrate and focus better. This modern playlist coupled with some iron man visuals creates an atmosphere of a computer laboratory filled with AR technologies and high-tech gadgets. If you enjoy chilled 808 beats with a cyberpunk vibe, then this mix is for you. Listen to it during your next work or study session to add inspiration and creativity. Works great for coding, programming, hacking, designing, editing, power armor crafting, studying, etc. If you enjoyed this video like, comment or subscribe to the channel. 🙏 Genre: Electronic music Style: Wave Mood: Calm, Future, Atmospheric, Cyber Feature: With Lyrics 📹 Similar videos Energy Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkcp_XPf2GiTOqUWAdvqM4ap Future Garage ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkdbssGgnnIDm3EnE2gmHyEQ Music Genres ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkffJbMAxlW17QgaBdhAfuY4 All Music VIdeos ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkemG2q7FaIGsQCcCHieasOE Work Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkc6L7Bgqzz_Q7q2JN2AqHV3 Chillout Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkeSTmryNClNxUkioFpq3Btx Study Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkcx8_AcwRjTPiYSauQTQeNi Hacker Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkfAWkk7-Clm18krBuziKQfr Ambient Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBketYRDDb8lheUOD4q7U27DR Chillstep Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkeH0adsnxZupMARfGxY6qik 🎧 Tracklist ► 00:00 Isorin - Reincarnation ► 01:35 Tomkillsjerry - Crush ► 03:45 Introvrt, Isorin - Emerald ► 06:09 Barnacle Boi - Onmymind ► 09:19 Ofdream - Our Father Enki ► 12:10 Trash Lord, Mirvzh - Moonlit ► 14:45 Resonata - Oleander ► 17:49 Nexorenity - End Point ► 21:02 Fugu Vibes - Abstract Timelapse ► 23:53 Mirvs - Imperterritus ► 26:04 Dotmpeg - S E E N ► 29:14 Xenaan - Sinner ► 31:46 Fate - Ghosts (Souls Edit) ► 33:52 Shiro - Euphoria ► 36:24 Harukasuka - Coves ► 39:48 lxserboy, Tensei - Beautiful ► 42:30 Ofdream - Sick And D ► 46:43 Throwmance - Introvert (Interwayne Edit) ► 49:43 Mystxrivl - Stay Forever ► 54:01 BlazinG, Nya - Lights ► 56:23 Internetboi - Alone ► 59:16 Lostlove - Heaven ► 1:01:43 Blurred - Noise (Harukasuka Remix) ► 1:04:18 Mrkryl - Holy Smokes  #Concentrationmusic #Wavemusic #Workmusic", "tags": "Avengers, Endgame, Engineer, Infinity War, Iron Man, Iron Man Mix, Laboratory, Marvel, Mechanic, Music, Study, Tony Stark, Workshop, aesthetic music, background music, chill mix, chill trap, coding music, cyberpunk music, deep focus music, focus music, focus music for work, music for studying, music for work, productivity music, programming music, slow music, study music", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jXslH7Z9-Fg/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ65lPQizkU", "title": "Perspective: Productivity of Monsoon Session | 09 August, 2022", "description": "The Monsoon Session of the Parliament which commenced on 18th of July, was adjourned sine die on 8th August, two working days ahead of schedule.

You can also get the same power nap music session but with alternative background sounds via the above link. This 30 minute power nap track should be listened to all the way through for the best effect. The frequency of the track increases towards the end, to help wake you up and reduce grogginess.  It starts at 10Hz, then gradually ramps down to 5Hz by 6 minutes. It then starts to go up to 12Hz in the last 4 minutes to wake you up.  If you want to have a deeper and longer nap, try my Deep Delta Power Nap track: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiEthl0O1Mw Key Benefits of a 30 Minute Power Nap A 30 minute power nap can help improve energy, alertness, stamina, mood, productivity, memory and reduce stress. How To Use It? Find a dark comfortable place to rest your head and relax. If you aren't able to nap somewhere dark, try using an eye mask to help block out the light. As you are trying to nap, it's always best to have your eyes closed. When to Listen? Don't listen to this power nap track too close to bedtime, because it might disrupt your sleep. The optimum time to power nap will vary, depending on when you woke up and started your day. This nap wheel tool will give you a useful guide: http://saramednick.com/htmls/book/napwheel.htm Headphones Are NOT Required That said, my personal preference is to use headphones, as I find they help to block out external sound and make it easier to nap. The choice is yours. Recommend Headphones For Sleep Normal headphones are usually very uncomfortable and impractical to use while sleeping. I've had some SleepPhones for over 10 years now and I highly recommend you give them a try.  SleepPhones are specifically designed for use while sleeping, with thin flat speakers that are contained inside a very comfortable headband. You can use them while lying on your side and they also have wireless versions, making them very easy and practical to use.  A discount deal for my viewers: Use the coupon code 'MINDAMEND' to get $10 off any headphones purchase on the SleepPhones website.  You can find out more about them here: https://www.MindAmend.com/SleepPhones How Loud Should The Volume Be? There is varying advice and opinions on the impact of volume with brainwave entrainment, with some saying the louder it is the more impact it has. From my own experience, my advice is to play it at a volume level you feel comfortable with. The main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones, so you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them. But you also don't want it so loud that its uncomfortable for you. Somewhere in the middle is my recommendation. Because you are trying to fall asleep with this track, I'd start off by trying a lower volume and see how you respond to that. © Copyright MindAmend.com Disclaimer: Any links to products I recommend are affiliate links and I will receive a small commission for any referrals I make.", "tags": "power nap, power napping, increase productivity, improve memory, increase energy, isochronic tones, theta nap, sleep, power nap music, benefits of power napping, power nap benefits, Memory (Quotation Subject), Productivity (Literature Subject), nap, napping, sleep music, benefits of a nap, nap benefits, mindamend, mind amend", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xqZS8AsqiW4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VJkXWmrJXI&pp=ugMICgJlcxABGAE%3D", "title": "OM Calculation: Productivity", "description": "How to calculate partial, multifactor, and total productivity.", "tags": "video, compartir, teléfono con cámara, teléfono con video, gratuito, subir", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-VJkXWmrJXI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SJzHtkx2NI", "title": "The Secret to Greater Productivity", "description": "Constraints are the secret to greater productivity and more work-life balance. 🏋🏼‍♀️ That’s why you need to create constraints (or boundaries) around your workday. Specifically, you need to commit to when you will start and stop work each day. There are three benefits to setting these kinds of constraints. 1️⃣ Constraints enable focus. If you set a hard stop to your workday, you’ll have to stay focused and avoid pointless activity. You won’t have the luxury of getting distracted or wasting time on fake work. 2️⃣ Constraints drive productivity. ****Not all tasks are created equal. High-leverage tasks help you achieve your most important goals. Low-leverage tasks don’t. Constraints force you to choose the high-leverage work that matters. And *that* is true productivity. 3️⃣ Constraints keep you balanced. ****Like water, work can be life-giving. But it can also flow all over and flood our other life domains. We need boundaries to contain it so we have room for non-work priorities. The key here is to set a hard start and a hard stop on your work day. This will force you to make better use of your time and give you the freedom to have a life. Like ❤️ this video if you are willing to embrace constraints and set hard boundaries on your work day.

Matthew shares research on the effects of caffeine on our sleep. Caffeine is a sleep disruptor, and just one dose of caffeine in the evening can decrease the amount of deep sleep by 20% Caffeine has a half-life of around 6-7 hours, but a quarter-life of around 12 hours. If you have a cup of coffee at noon, a quarter of that caffeine can still be circulating around your brain at midnight. We often don’t think about the implications of our caffeine consumption - but consuming our caffeine before noon, or switching to decaffeinated drinks, could have benefits for the quality of our sleep.

Those who have good memory tend be much more successful in Life not only because of the ability to reproduce the knowledge when needed, but also the ability to analyse the information in the best way possible for successful outcomes.

This is what a typical work day would be for a knife technician in the factory and outside of workplace. The Japanese work culture can be seen in her everyday activities. Also, this is how Japanese knives are made. Nene works as a knife technician at Zwilling J.A. Henckels Japan, originally a 291-year-old German Knife maker who eventually setup an office in Japan and later acquired their knife factory here in Seki city, also known in Japan as the city of blades, crafting flawless samurai swords and knives for more than 800 years and producing half of Japan’s total knives in this city alone. Today, 90% of the company’s knives sold in Japan are actually made here at this factory. Throughout her shift, she’s tasked with inspecting knives being crafted that day, to ensure that each knife meets the factory’s strict quality standards. Which also means that she’s responsible for knowing the details about each and every knife that’s crafted in the factory including the entire build process for that individual knife and the technical requirements each one must satisfy in order for her to fully perform the inspections. In fact, all the workers are required to undergo basic training when joining, and during the training period, each worker’s skills are assessed and based on their strengths, assigned a specific role such as sharpening knifes, welding, etc. Apparently, sharpening the knives by hand is one of the most challenging parts when crafting a knife. So much so, the factory itself only has 9 specialists who have mastered the skill, and at the moment only 2 who are skilled enough to perform Kiwami Honbazuke, the most extreme and technical knife sharpening possible.

Cover: The Fab Four. \"A Day In The Life\" es una canción de la banda británica The Beatles y el último tema del álbum Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, de 1967. Acreditada a Lennon-McCartney, la canción incluye distintos fragmentos que fueron escritos por los miembros de la banda John Lennon y Paul McCartney por separado, con la colaboración de una orquesta adicional, siendo esta una de las últimas veces en que realizaron una canción juntos como en sus primeros años. Mientras la letra de Lennon estaba inspirada en artículos periodísticos de aquella época, McCartney se inspiró en su juventud. La decisión de relacionar secciones de la canción con crescendos orquestales y de terminar la misma con un acorde sostenido de piano se idearon solo después de que la canción fue grabada. El 29 de agosto de 1966 los Beatles dieron su último concierto, sin avisar, en el Candlestick Park de San Francisco, en este caso sí que utilizaron un equipo de amplificación para las voces: un número indeterminado de etapas de potencia Altec 1569 de 80 varios y unos monitores de escenario. Ahí se acabó una historia de amor/odio con los directos del grupo que se remontaba a 1960. Solo tres meses después, exactamente el jueves 24 de noviembre de 1966 los Beatles entraban en el Estudio Dos de la EMI para empezar a grabar su octavo elepé de estudio: el Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. El resto, como suele decirse, es historia. El 21 de enero de 1967 empieza la grabación de ‘A Day In The Life‘, las primeras cuatro tomas fueron grabadas desde las 19:30 hasta las 2:30 de la madrugada. John a la guitarra acústica, Paul al piano, Ringo a las maracas y George al bongo. El papel de Starr tocando la batería, es comúnmente denomina como una de sus mejores actuaciones. El tema estaba perfectamente estructurado y no hubo ninguna posterior variación formal, estaba claro que por lo menos John y Paul habían estado trabajando en él, quizás en el estudio mismo. George M. dice que fue idea de John intercalar unos compases desde el final de su parte hasta el principio de la de Paul y la del final del tema. Se oye a Mal Evans marcando los compases de los fragmentos de momento vacíos con su voz y tocando el piano y a un despertador sonando justo antes del fragmento de McCartney, ese despertador se coló en la pista de piano y ahí se quedó hasta la edición del tema. Inicialmente la BBC prohibió la difusión de la pieza pues la línea \"I'd love to turn you on\" (en literal \"Me encantaría excitarte\") que se menciona en la canción se suponía que hacía referencia a las drogas. Negaron que hubiera referencias de drogas y se quejaron públicamente sobre la prohibición en una cena de su mánager, Brian Epstein. Lennon dijo que la canción era simplemente de un accidente y su víctima, y llamó a la línea en cuestión \"la más inocente de las frases\". Desde su lanzamiento, ha aparecido como lado B y en numerosas recopilaciones del grupo. Considerada por muchos como una de las obras maestras de la banda de Liverpool y como una de las mejores canciones de la historia. Ocupa el puesto 28 de las 500 más grandes canciones de todos los tiempos, según la revista Rolling Stone. Existe cierta controversia sobre la inspiración de la primera estrofa. En numerosas entrevistas, Lennon afirmaba que la inspiración principal fue la muerte de Tara Browne, heredero de 21 años de la fortuna Guiness, y amigo íntimo de Lennon y McCartney, quien chocó su Lotus Elan el 18 de diciembre de 1966, cuando un Volkswagen lo arrojó hacia a un lado de la calle en su camino hacia Redcliffe Gardens, Earls Court.  John también agregó información sobre una película en el verso \"The English Army had just won the war\" en referencia a su papel en la película How I Won the War, publicada el 18 de octubre de 1967.​ La última estrofa estaba inspirada en una noticia del Daily Mail en enero de 1967, que hablaba sobre un elevado número de hoyos en en una carretera de Blackburn, un pueblo de Lancashire. Después tuvo problemas con la letra de esta estrofa ya que no tenía idea de cómo conectar \"Now they know how many holes takes to\", y \"the Albert Hall\". Fue nominada a un Grammy en 1967 por \"Mejor Arreglo de Acompañamiento Vocal o Instrumental\", sin embargo, perdió ante la canción \"Strangers in the Night\" de Frank Sinatra. • https://youtu.be/GCMfYZ56B9U - Este es un cover hecho por una de las tantas bandas tributo llamada The Fab Four, entre tantas versiones de la canción, esta es la mejor que yo he escuchado en vivo. ♯Ayúdame compartiendo esto a tus conocidos.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, de 1967. Acreditada a Lennon-McCartney, pero mayormente escrita por Lennon, la canción incluye distintos fragmentos que fueron escritos por los miembros de la banda John Lennon y Paul McCartney por separado, con la colaboración de una orquesta adicional, siendo esta una de las últimas veces en que realizaron una canción juntos como en sus primeros años. Mientras la letra de Lennon estaba inspirada en artículos periodísticos de aquella época, McCartney se inspiró en su juventud. La decisión de relacionar secciones de la canción con crescendos orquestales y de terminar la misma con un acorde sostenido de piano se idearon solo después de que la canción fue grabada. Inicialmente la BBC prohibió la difusión de la pieza pues la línea «I'd love to turn you on» («Me encantaría excitarte» –aquí cambié la frase–) que se menciona en la canción se suponía que hacía referencia a las drogas. Desde su lanzamiento, ha aparecido como lado B y en numerosas recopilaciones del grupo. Ha sido versionada por otros artistas, incluyendo a Bobby Darin, Neil Young, Jeff Beck, The Libertines, The Bee Gees, Phish y desde 2008, por McCartney en sus interpretaciones en vivo. Considerada por muchos como una de las obras maestras de la banda de Liverpool y como una de las mejores canciones de la historia. Ocupa el puesto 28 de las 500 más grandes canciones de todos los tiempos, según la revista Rolling Stone. Existe cierta controversia sobre la inspiración de la primera estrofa. En numerosas entrevistas, Lennon afirmaba que la inspiración principal fue la muerte de Tara Browne, heredero de 21 años de la fortuna Guiness, y amigo íntimo de Lennon y McCartney, quien chocó contra un camión aparcado con su Lotus Elan el 18 de diciembre de 1966, cuando un Volkswagen lo arrojó hacia un lado de la calle en su camino hacia Redcliffe Gardens, Earls Court. Sin embargo, George Martin comentó que es una referencia a las drogas (así como la frase «I'd love to turn you on» y algunos otros pasajes de la canción) y que mientras escribía la letra, Lennon imaginaba a un político ficticio que se había detenido en un semáforo. La descripción del accidente en «A Day in the Life» no es una descripción literal del fatal accidente de Browne. Lennon dijo: «No copié el accidente, Tara no se destrozó la cabeza, pero eso estaba en mi mente cuando estaba escribiendo ese verso. Los detalles del accidente en la canción —no haber visto el semáforo y la multitud alrededor— fueron igualmente parte de la ficción.» Lennon también agregó información sobre una película en el verso «The English Army had just won the war» («El ejército inglés acababa de ganar la guerra»), en referencia a su papel en la película How I Won the War, publicada el 18 de octubre de 1967. La última estrofa estaba inspirada en una noticia del Daily Mail en enero de 1967, que hablaba sobre un elevado número de hoyos en una carretera de Blackburn, un pueblo de Lancashire. Lennon tuvo problemas con la letra de esta estrofa ya que no tenía idea de cómo conectar «Now they know how many holes takes to» («Ahora que saben cuántos hoyos toma») y «the Albert Hall». Su amigo Terry Doran le sugirió que lo conectara con la palabra fill («llenar») el Albert Hall. McCartney aportó la parte central de la canción, una pequeña parte de piano en la que estaba trabajando independientemente, con una letra acerca de una persona corriente cuya rutina mañanera termina derivando en un sueño. Había escrito la pieza como una recopilación de sus años de juventud, que incluía sus viajes en el autobús 82, fumar y asistir a clase. Lennon dijo: «Yo tenía la mayoría de la canción y de la letra, pero él contribuyó con esta pequeña probada que tenía alrededor en su cabeza y que no podía usar para nada», refiriéndose a la sección de McCartney.", "tags": "video, compartir, teléfono con cámara, teléfono con video, gratuito, subir", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P49vsgHht18/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwTN2slUhU", "title": "A Day in the Life of a Harvard Computer Science Student", "description": "Sign up for Brilliant: https://brilliant.org/JohnFish/ Follow me: https://www.instagram.com/thejohnfish/ Other important links below ⬇️ I'm John Fish, and this video is a day in my life as a Harvard Computer Science student.

This is what a typical day working in a Japan shop and Japanese kitchen is like for a Japanese worker in this field. Japanese work culture can not only be viewed in large Japanese companies, but also smaller Japanese business with a few staff. This Day in the Life features a Japanese natto shop called Amakusa Natto, a specialized natto store established in 2019 and how to make natto, fermented soybeans. They craft a premium high-quality natto all 100%....by hand. A relatively young company with, with only a few staff, producing some of the best handmade natto possible. Natto, aka fermented soybeans, is probably most known worldwide for its powerful smell, distinctive flavor, and gooey texture but the shop uniquely crafts their natto with less smell and gooeyness making it more palatable for customers while still maintaining its super food and extremely nutritious qualities. Regardless, 85% of the Japanese population have come to enjoy natto’s ultra unique taste and texture. Interestingly though, many may think that rice is the go-to breakfast carb choice for Japanese, but when questioned, 56% of Japanese today answered that they tend to choose bread over rice. Given the typical work day in Japan, it seems only natural for people who are in a morning rush to save time on preparing a bowl of rice. In fact, soybeans are one of the most important ingredients in Japanese cuisine, as 3.5 Million tons of soybeans are used every year and it can be found in the most common Japanese ingredients such as Tofu, soy sauce, miso, kinako powder and of course natto, included everyday in Japanese meals anytime of the day.

Here it is, one of the truly epic Beatles songs. A haunting, massive track.  Covering this was a hell of an endeavor, encompassing 2 months of effort. There's no way I can describe all the magic of this song in this space, but it was truly a privilege picking this apart.  This little project started for a simple reason: I realized that despite having the best drum part of perhaps any song in music history, there's no note-for-note recreation of this song anywhere on YouTube. As someone who is always up for a challenge, I decided to make my own! I slowed down the fills, studied them, and played it enough times to get the feel. To get the sound perfect, I spent day after day messing around with micing and tuning my set. I even consulted Geoff Emerick's notes and removed the bottom tom heads, which was great advice! After 8 separate days recording and testing, I finally hit upon a close sound. Viola!  But getting the drums right was just the beginning! Everything else about this song is interesting. John's jazzy acoustic chords during the middle 8 and that strikingly thick J-160E tone. Paul's brilliantly quirky piano fills (major props to Mattiboo's cover for illustrating how complex those parts are). Weirdly eclectic percussion (maracas, congas, AND tambourine). This song is BANANAS. Can you believe this was released by the same dudes who sang \"She Loves You\"? Man, to be alive at the time. Minds must've exploded everywhere.  The bass also took 3-4 attempts before getting a close sound. Paul's really playing less of a bassline and more of a countermelody, similar to \"Something.\" And just like that cover, I needed to memorize it note-for-note to get the song right. Man, what a song!  Trivia: - Initially recorded on January 19, 1967 with the working title \"In the Life Of...\"  - Yes, that's the original strings/orchestra part! I used the isolated track as a placeholder and intended to make my own version with Cinematic Studio. Incredibly, the orignal track was not blocked! You can hear some of my own brass in the \"Ahhs\" dream section, which I blended with the original.  - I own no congas, so I used a djembe (thanks Mark!). Sounded damn good! Thank you infinitely to my Beatles brain trust for your advice - Clay, Jack, Galeazzo, Ryan, Perry, DLD2, Nathan, and many others.

This is working life in Japan if you were to work in the hotel industry.  In Japan, there’s a unique hospitality custom called OMOTENASHI. Directly translated, Omote meaning public face and nashi meaning nothing, combined it means services are always completely genuine and honest. Because it’s so deeply rooted in Japanese culture, the staff make extra efforts to provide guests with the best experience possible without expecting anything in return. We follow Yohei's work day in Tokyo from morning until evening .Yohei works as the assistant manager at APA hotel Shinjuku Gyoenmae. APA is one of the largest hotel chains in japan. APA hotel uniquely identify as a New Urban style hotel high Quality, High Functionally without all the unnecessary services providing all guests with a good night’s sleep, often mistaken as a Japanese business hotel, which are typically budget style hotels close to the train station, originally intended for Japanese salarymen traveling between cities for business. Often the rooms are smaller with bare amenities, single bed, desk, tv, refrigerator, unit bath and toilet. In Japan, tipping is not customary and in some ways can be awkward as it’s unexpected. It’s ingrained in Japanese culture to take pride in your work no matter at what level, so receiving a tip as an incentive to delivery the best service is viewed as unnecessary, all tying back to Omotenashi.

Things like rules such as showing your id or the way the \"cantine\" works or the kind of food that is available can differ quite a lot (the sound between each class is also different for each school). In some school students are freer and therefore is some other you can have more restriction. The type of event and class available in high school can change as well. For example in my high school we could have additional classes during the vacation if we wanted to which is very rare in public school, also we were forced to have an internship during our first year of high school and had an oral presentation (while all of my friends who were from different high school, were already on vacation). Events like the carnival, the day of the music, chic day, prom night depends on the school (high school u0026 junior high school). The specialty classes available are also diverse: some can have languages like Chinese or Russian, others might have special classes for elite athletes (mine was specialized in handball but there were also other sports) or specialty like cinema, theatre, performing art, fine arts ... \"  Credit: N S - A comment from my video of my first day of French public school.

My name is Max Reisinger (Rye - Singer) and I’m a 17-year old student-athlete/entrepreneur/visual creative. I’m currently in my last year in high school and am applying to college/university (wish me luck). I’ve been creating videos here on YouTube since the beginning of 2019 when I moved to France for 7 months with my family. I attended a French public school during my time there and filmed all of my experiences/travels/new perspectives. After moving back to America, I started a business (https://perspectopia.com) and have continued to film how I use optimism to live a happy, well-balanced life.  MY BUSINESS: 📦 At the beginning of 2020, I started a clothing brand - Perspectopia (Perspective + Utopia). My ultimate goal with this YouTube channel has always been to create a community and I strongly believe that optimistic perspectives can change your life. So, I decided to create a community based upon these ideas and also decided to create a line of clothing so that you can represent these same ideals.  The first collection launched at the beginning of 2020 where I released a limited round of 100 embroidered champion hoodies. You guys absolutely blew me away and they sold out in less than 9 minutes!!?

Brown lll Composer Lyricist: Renee Armand \"One Day in Your Life\" is a song recorded by Michael Jackson for his 1975 album, Forever, Michael. Written by Sam Brown III and composed by Renée Armand, it was later released on March 25, 1981, as a single from the compilation album of the same name due to the commercial interest that generated from the sales of Jackson's hit 1979 album Off the Wall, despite the fact that Jackson had released that album on Epic Records instead of Motown. While the modest US hit, it was a bigger hit in the UK, where it became Jackson's first solo recording to hit No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. It was number one in the UK for two weeks in June and July 1981. It also topped the Irish Singles Chart, and also featured strongly on the South African singles charts. It was released on the Motown label. It went on to become the sixth best-selling single of 1981 in the UK. Robert Christgau called this song a romantic ballad that is as credible on its \"own terms as the rockers.\" Five years prior, a cover version by Johnny Mathis for his Feelings album charted in the U.S. and Canada. #michaeljackson #onedayinyourlife #jackson5 #80smusichits #80s #lyricvideo #lyrics #hitsongs Michael Jackson - One Day In Your Life (Lyrics)", "tags": "michael jackson, one day in your life, the greatest songs, lyrics, hit songs, michael jackson songs, michael jackson one day in your life, michael jackson moonwalk, jackson 5, 80s music hits, 80s love songs, 80s music greatest hits, one day in your life michael jackson, one day in your life karaoke, michael jackson music, relaxing music, michael jackson billie jean, just call my name and ill be there, michael jackson performance, michael jackson performing live, music video", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xvBwbBX8-Dw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6zTBw_pq6Y", "title": "A Day in the Life of a Harvard PhD Student 2022", "description": "This is a day in my life as a Harvard physics PhD student in 2022.

My name is Max Reisinger (Rye - Singer) and I’m a 17-year old student-athlete/entrepreneur/visual creative. I’m currently in my last year in high school and am applying to college/university (wish me luck). I’ve been creating videos here on YouTube since the beginning of 2019 when I moved to France for 7 months with my family. I attended a French public school during my time there and filmed all of my experiences/travels/new perspectives. After moving back to America, I started a business (https://perspectopia.com) and have continued to film how I use optimism to live a happy, well-balanced life.  MY BUSINESS: 📦 At the beginning of 2020, I started a clothing brand - Perspectopia (Perspective + Utopia). My ultimate goal with this YouTube channel has always been to create a community and I strongly believe that optimistic perspectives can change your life. So, I decided to create a community based upon these ideas and also decided to create a line of clothing so that you can represent these same ideals.  The first collection launched at the beginning of 2020 where I released a limited round of 100 embroidered champion hoodies. You guys absolutely blew me away and they sold out in less than 9 minutes!!? If you want to support the Perspectopia movement and rep the brand, follow @persptopia on Instagram (https://instagram.com/perspectopia) to get updates on all future drops, updates, and behind the scenes!  JOIN MY COMMUNITY: 🗺 I would love for you to join the Perspectopia discord community! - https://discord.gg/s9Enjrp We host weekly game nights, movie nights, discussions on different topics, language lessons, homework help, accountability groups, and much more! See you there- GET IN TOUCH: 📲 If you’d like to ask me any questions, tweeting @Maxbrsee directly will be the quickest way to get a response!

Follow a Keio University student from morning until evening. This is a day in the life of University student in Japan attending Keio University, one of the top universities in Japan. Japan university student life is much different than the Japanese salaryman life as college students have a bit more freedom to pursue hobbies, especially in their senior year of school in Japan. An average Japanese student in Tokyo may have between 15-23 course hours per week while a Japan University student 4th year Senior will have much less such as 9 hours of course hours per week. Yusuke, 22 year old Policy Management Major at Keio University lives with his parents in a 2 story house which is commuting distance to school via train and bus. Typical Japanese University life outside of class and study, also allows for part-time jobs and also a social life with friends. In fact, many Japanese students take on part-time jobs and find the time to hang out with friends in groups and join Japanese University Circles. Generally, a typical Japanese student’s class semester grade is based on assignments, presentations, group projects and 1 final exam at the end of the semester. But one interesting aspect about the Japanese university grading system is that many teachers don’t let students know how each category is weighted so students can’t calculate what they need to score on their final exam to earn a specific mark for the class. Watch the video and let me know in the comments how this compares to your University Life in your country.

Working in Japan as a masterchef in Tokyo not only must you prepare delicious food in your Japanese restaurant, but must also throughout the Japanese work day, manage all the different staff, issues and business requirements. Life in Japan for a Japanese Chef working in Tokyo is quite demanding so a Master Chef in Japan must have passion for his work. Life in Toyo for a Japanese world class chef or a Japanese expert chef is also challenging because of the long work hours. In fact, the average working day in Japan for many salarymen or Japanese office workers are quite long, but a Japanese master chef can also have long Japanese work day hours, especially if the Master Chef in Japan has to run multiple restaurants. Japan food industry is also competitive so food quality is key and regular food tastings are a must. Born in Kobe, known for its mountains, ocean, sake and Kobe Beef as well as traveling the world, all helped inspire Hal Yamashita to create a new style cuisine called Shin Washoku, which utilizes modern techniques to bring out the full potential of Japanese ingredients. One of Hal’s specialties is his Signature rolled Kobe-Beef filled with Sea Urchin and topped with smoked caviar. But as master chef, he’s able to prepare Kobe Beef in many different ways making his Japanese restaurant one of the best places to eat Japanese Kobe Beef in Tokyo. Hal's main Japanese restaurant is called Hal Yamashita Tokyo in Roppongi Midtown and in this video we also visit Tokyo Entotsu and Hal Yamashita Otemachi Lounge. This is Japan work day of a Japanese master chef.

Japanese workers are often portrayed as Salarymen but in this video we focus on Japanese food services industry and what it is like to work in a Japanese restaurant. This is a day in the life of a Japanese Chef, Tetsuya, 41 years old, working in Japan at a ramen store, karashibi miso ramen Kinkanbo. It's a popular spicy ramen shop in Tokyo Japan serving a devil ramen. We see Japanese working hours as well as Japanese workers in a Tokyo ramen restaurant, a peek into Japanese life. Tetsuya starts the day in his apartment and as an average Japanese worker, he commutes to work in Tokyo via train. It only takes him 20 minutes to get to work, but soon after arriving, he's busy working at the Japanese food restaurant and preparing Japanese ramen noodles for customers. His main duty is the manager of the ramen shop, but he also creates new gentei limited time menu items as a Japanese ramen chef. Life in Tokyo is amazing and part of this is because we have dedicated workers in Japan that keep the city running. To be a Japanese chef you must really have a passion for what you do. If you are ever looking for a spicy food challenge or spicy ramen challenge in Tokyo, then the Kikanbo ramen shop should be you first destination. But don't worry, if you can't eat spicy ramen, the ramen shop also prepares non-spicy version of the ramen bowl. Customers can choose their level of spiciness from low all the way to Oni level, aka Devil ramen. Enjoy this Japanese food tour of a Japanese ramen shop.

Constructing Japanese homes in Tokyo can be a complicated process, so it's common for Japanese living in Tokyo and Japanese living in Japan to ask a professional home building company like like Daiwa House to help manage and construct their home. We follow Yuya from morning until evening and throughout his workday to show the Japanese working culture and construction culture in Japan. Construction workers in Japan have their own unique routines and process when building a house in Japan and this a peek into their daily lives in Tokyo. Japan is also ranked 4th in the world for having earthquakes so earthquake resistant building construction laws have been in place since 1924 and have been updated over the years, such as the shin-taishin standard, requiring that all buildings must be able to withstand a stage 6 seismic event on Japan’s 7-stage seismic scale.  Yuya is a Ni-Kyu Kenchikushi, a prefecture license certified second-class architect which allows him to manage small housing construction. A first class license would allow for larger construction projects such as olympic stadiums but would require passing a national qualifying exam available to four year university graduates with a minimum 2 years of practical building related experience, where only about 10% of the applicants are able to pass. Yuya has been working with the company for about 3 years now and his entire first year was spent training with 1000 other new grad employees who were all hired at the same time, in Japanese called Shinsotsu Saiyo. (新卒採用). In Japan, it’s typical for large companies to hire new grads in a batch usually in April to align with Japan’s standardized school schedule.

Such a great night. We had a blast. It was a joy to get to sing so many great songs by so many great British artists while in London, with this song being no exception. Maybe I’ll sing it in the Albert Hall someday. :) And what do you think became of those dancing couples when the song sped up in the middle? I hope no one was injured!

This is what a typical day working in Japan is like at a Toy company as a Japanese worker. We see Japanese work culture throughout the day and see how it is to work in japan as well how it is to live in Japan during this time before work and after work. Kana works at Sega Toys, creating some of the most popular toys in Japan, formed in 1998 from its parent company Sega, one of the largest video game and entertainment companies in the world. Although many of the Sega Sammy companies are located in the same building, Sega Toys operate independently with 110 hard working staff to create award winning toys even with major brands like anpanman and disney. Kana is originally from Aichi prefecture but moved to Yamanashi prefecture to attend university majoring in Regional Sociology. Like many Japanese university students, she started her shushoku katsdo, aka Job Hunting while in school and was able to secure employment before graduation which led her to Tokyo to start a new life and career. And as a person who has a deep appreciation for all things cute and fun, she naturally found a fit at her job for the last 4 years as a Toy Planner creating Japanese toys.

As a political figure known for his ominous demeanor, his allegedly villainous tactics, and signature style of governing, there’s so much to wonder about what a day in the life of Vladimir Putin looks like.

This is also a tour of her Japanese office, Pasona. We start this typical day in her Japanese home, commute via train to her Tokyo office in Otemachi and spend a day in the life of Emi at her working place. We see her typical working hours in Japan and how it is working in Japan as a female in her position. Her day in the life in Japan may be a bit different than some Japanese salarymen, but her experiences in the office with chorei, senpai / kouhai, and kenshu is a very typical in experiences in many Japanese offices. If you want to know how work in Japan or want to know how work in Tokyo, this could be how your job in Japan could be like. The Tokyo office itself, is probably an above average Japanese office in terms design and the business culture a bit more progressive than most traditional Japanese companies, but this Japanese company still maintains a very traditional Japanese office environment. So all in all, this is an example of Japan life as well as Tokyo life if you were to work in a Japanese company. You should always be aware of Japanese culture when working in a Japanese office. This Japanese office has a gym, English school and even a farm all in the building. Pasona is one of the largest staffing services company in Japan. There’s about 4000 staff in her office alone and about 9000 in total worldwide.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band de 1967. Desde su salida original del álbum, ha sido sacada como lado-B, hasta en varios albumes compilatorios. La canción ha sido cantada por varios artistas, entre ellos Bobby Daring, Sting, Neil Young, Jeff Beck, Los Bee Gees, y desde 2008, Paul McCartney en sus apariciones en vivo. La revista Rolling Stone la colocó en la 22ava mejor canción de todos los tiempos y la Revista Q Music la coloco en el primer puesto de las mejores canciones de la historia. La canción es resultado de la combinación de dos fragmentos distintos, pero en última instancia, complementarios, uno de los cuales había sido escrito por Lennon y el otro, por McCartney. Este último fue ubicado a la mitad de la canción aproximadamente, en medio del fragmento de Lennon. Apareciendo en ella letras impresionistas, innovadoras técnicas de producción y complejos preparativos incluyendo un cacofónico y parcialmente improvisado crescendo orquestal, la canción es considerada uno de los más ambiciosos, influyentes e innovadores trabajos en la historia de la música pop. El piano del final, es tocado por cinco personas (Lennon, McCartney, Starr, George Martin y Mal Evans) en tres pianos. Esta canción, además de ser muy popular, representa un parteaguas en la música instrumental ya que la utilización de sonidos es muy variada y armoniosa además de las voces las cuales, cabe decir, son espectaculares.

This video helps explain what is wagyu beef and how it is made in Japan, specifically Miyazaki Beef 宮崎牛 a premium Wagyu. We follow, Ryuji, who runs a Japanese wagyu cattle farm in Miyazaki. As mentioned in the video, if you want to help support the farm check out This is Ryuji's typical day a day a wagyu farmer from morning until evening. We even visit a Japanese Wagyu Cattle auction during his day and see him sell 3 of of his Japanese kuroge black haired cows.  Ryuji raises Miyazaki Gyu, Gyu meaning beef, from Japanese Black Haired cattle, a brand of Wagyu. Wagyu literally translated means Japanese Beef, but all beef raised in Japan domestically is not considered Wagyu. Wagyu is a premium grade beef in Japan and refers specifically to four breeds of cattle - Black hair, Brown hair, Polled and Shorthorn raised and bred in Japan with the strictest guidelines and requirements ultimately producing a high-end quality Japanese beef known worldwide for it’s beautiful marbling and deep umami flavor.  In fact, Japan has over 200 premium Wagyu brands throughout the country each with its own unique methods to raise it’s cattle, The Kobe Beef brand, is probably the most known overseas because it was the first wagyu brand promoted internationally due it being located at one Japan’s largest port cities. Ryuji’s Miyazaki Beef brand, specifically produces the highest grade of Wagyu possible, A4 and A5 quality, which is one of the reasons why Miyazaki Beef is one of the leading wagyu brands in Japan  Watch all of my Japan Day in the Life videos on this playlist - https://tokyozebra.com/ditl Get my Tokyo u0026 Japan Merch and show your support! - https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch --- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ---- See My Life in Japan behind the scenes - https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra Questions about Japan or Japan Travel?

I saw a film today oh boy The English Army had just won the war A crowd of people turned away but I just had to look Having read the book I'd love to turn you on Woke up, fell out of bed, Dragged a comb across my head Found my way downstairs and drank a cup, And looking up I noticed I was late. Found my coat and grabbed my hat Made the bus in seconds flat Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, and Somebody spoke and I went into a dream I read the news today oh boy Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire And though the holes were rather small They had to count them all Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Living in Japan and working in Japan is quite a unique experience. This is a day in the life of Japanese worker, Makoto, 27 years old who lives in a Tokyo 3-story house with his family. This Tokyo salaryman works in a small Tokyo office, but spends many of his Japan working hours traveling from client to client on the Tokyo trains. Makoto works for a company called Mobal and as many Japanese salarymen, he entered the company straight from a Japanese University and he plans to spend his entire salaryman career at the same company. That is the life in Japan for a salaryman. We take a look inside what it's like to work in a small Tokyo office as well as to visit clients throughout Tokyo city area. His job experiences maybe unique to his company, but fundamentally he is very much an average salaryman. He commutes by train everyday to get to work and has to ride his mama-chari bike to get to the train station from his home.  This Tokyo salaryman life has him arriving to work early and working late. As a salaryman, Makoto receives a standard salary every month for all the long work hours. The Japanese office is also configured so his boss' desk is right in front of him, quite a Japanese style office working environment. This very average Japanese work day and work lifestyle showcases a true day in Japan work life.

But outside of the media's eye, what is a typical day like in the life of a Barça superstar? This video will give you some idea of that.

True, he hasn't erected a golden statue in his honor, nor did he title himself as a living God as some of his more eccentric colleagues in Asia had. However, despite this omission, Putin is still one of the wealthiest rulers in the whole world.  Up until a few days ago, Vladimir Putin was a genuine superstar. He was shrouded in mystery and adored by millions worldwide. That was, of course, before he was revealed to be an unstable lunatic ready to blow up the world if he doesn't get what he wants. Whether he was depicted riding a horse shirtless, swimming in a river, playing hockey, or simply punching a bear in the face, the Russian president radiated authority, brute strength, and somehow charismatic terror. Such an extraordinary man indeed has some extraordinary days filled with luxury, lavish spending, and of course, lots of investments and work.  Thanks For Watching: A Day in The Life of Vladimir Putin (World's Richest President) Welcome to Luxury Zone, On this Channel we share everything about Luxury and help you experience the billionaire lifestyle.

This Japanese Family of 3 with Japanese husband shows how life in Tokyo is like for a new Japanese mother raising a Japanese baby. We follow Moe, 27 year old Japanese mother of Sutan, a 9-month old Japanese infant, from morning until evening to show what type of activities a Japanese mom has during the day. Inside of their Japanese home in Tokyo, we can see what type of Japanese house chores she performs, what type of Japanese food she cooks and how she takes care of her Japanese daughter. This probably would not be considered an average Japanese family but many of their activities are that of a typical Japanese family. This day in the life of Japanese housewife and Japanese baby will feature the joys and struggles a mom has raising a Japanese baby for the first time. Life in Japan starts here as baby and you can see how certain behaviors are taught to babies like saying itadakimasu before the baby eats. I hope you enjoy watching the life of this Tokyo family and their life in Tokyo.

What starts as a heist job for the duo becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach the prize before the ruthless Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes he and his family are the rightful heirs. If Nate and Sully can decipher the clues and solve one of the world’s oldest mysteries, they stand to find $5 billion in treasure and perhaps even Nate’s long-lost brother...but only if they can learn to work together.  #TomHolland #Sony #SonyPictures #Uncharted #NathanDrake #BTS #BehindTheScenes", "tags": "video, compartir, teléfono con cámara, teléfono con video, gratuito, subir", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B6OZ40sGA4M/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvqIQ7GblrI", "title": "A day in the life of Neymar Jr", "description": "For Neymar Jr., life just keeps getting better. Every. Single. Day. The Brazilian striker, now in his fourth season donning the Blaugrana jersey, enjoys a special relationship with Lionel Messi and has been an integral part of the team’s most recent successes — including his lead role as Lord of the Comeback in the final minutes of Barça's historic win over PSG at Camp Nou — all the while his play with the Brazilian national team continues reaching dizzying new heights, inviting all sorts of comparisons with his countryman, the great Pelé. So, what is it like to be Neymar? To find out, we have compiled a video chock full of his daily activities. See the Barça number 11 as he arrives at the team’s training center and puts in his daily work on the practice field. Watch him as he comes into the stadium ahead of a match, as he travels with the team to a road game, and as he gets up close and personal with the fans. He even has a special pregame routine!

We follow Sho from morning until evening to see what a complete day would be like working at a Japanese figure making company. Sho works in Japan as a Genkeishi, also known as a Figure Sculptor. Sho sculpts his anime figure prototypes by hand using Nendo, in English putty or clay, in his case, a polyester putty. And for his main tools, uses a toothpick to add putty and a sharp q tip to smooth out the surface. Today, he is working on a Nedoroido ( Nendoroid ) style figure. We also meet and talk to some of the other office workers in the Japanese company and give a full office tour. This is life in Tokyo for a Japanese anime and manga figure sculptor.

After college I decided to take a leap of faith. So I moved to San Diego California to pursue my passion for videography/ Youtube. Overall I'm a pretty chill person, outside of Youtube I like to longboard, dance, play video games, lift weights and hangout with my friends. I know that success on Youtube won't happen overnight but I'm willing to stay patient and put in the work to try to prefect my craft daily. This Youtube channel will be centered around my life after college. You will be able to see all of the ups and downs on my journey to success. So if you like the content make sure you subscribe so you can be apart of the Rome Life Family. (Let's build our own personal Rome's together.)  What is the Rome Life ? And What does it mean to be apart of it? Rome Life is something I started during my Sophomore year of high school (one of the worst times in my life) it started off as me documenting my journey to recovery from my shoulder surgery but eventually it turned into a platform that I could use to encourage myself as well as others to chase our dreams. Rome Life isn't just a saying it's a way of life and for the people who want to be apart of it have to realize that. Rome wasn't built in a day it took a lot of handwork time and most importantly patience. So you can't expect your dreams to be any different This is a reaction video used to educated and give my feedback on the song and artist ||COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER – https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/mo...

This is the programmer life in Japan. As a Japanese game programmer you'll see what it is like commuting to work in Tokyo and going to work at one of the largest Video Game Studios in Japan as well as working with other Japanese video game developers, software engineers, video game devs, game designers and even Japanese game directors for a major Japanese Video Game studio. We follow Masa, a 23 year old, Japanese programmer, throughout his workday and witness what he does during his Japanese working hours as a Japanese game programmer at the Bandai Namco Studios office in Tokyo. We'll even interact with directors from popular Japanese video game titles such as Tekken and CodeVein. Plus we'll get to see what a Japanese programmer from one of the large Video Game companies in Japan does after work with friends. This look inside a Japanese game dev's life is pretty unique and should provide some insight for those people who want to work in Japan as a game developer or game programmer. Also, this day in the life of a Japanese programmer will show you what it takes to be a Japanese programmer. As you would expect, most of the work day is spent programming and coding, but there are other unique aspects of the Japanese programmers life we are able to see in this video.

This would be a typical day for a Japan firefighter in Tokyo. To become a firefighter in Tokyo, applicants must pass an exhaustive fire department recruitment examination that is held only once a year which includes both a written and physical exam, culminating into a final interview. Each year there are only a limited number of positions so becoming a Japanese firefighter is highly competitive. Last year, only 1 out 14 applicants, about 7%, were able to pass the full firefighter exam. Soushi became a Tokyo firefighter 1 year after graduating high school and is in his 4th year as Tokyo Firefighter. In Japan, firefighters have 10 different ranks, badges have different numbers of stars and stripes. All firefighters like Soushi start with the first rank, 1 star and 1 stripe, and to earn a promotion to the next rank, 2 stars, the department will generally review a candidates performance, after around 4 years. So, he’s almost there.  The next rank after 3 stars would be 2 strips and 1 star. In Japan, the Firefighters work a 24-hour shift and it officially commences at a large meeting called Daikotai in the morning.

This is what a typical day working in Japan is like if you work in the Casino Entertainment and leisure Industry. This is typical life living in Tokyo and working a morning shift. The Japan working culture is shown as we follow Kento, 27 year old Pachinko Parlor Hall Manager from morning until evening to see what his average Japanese job is like. Pachinko Hall manager works at Maruhan, one of the largest Pachinko companies in Japan. Pachinko is a type of mechanical ball game resembling pinball, but instead with many tiny balls and with the aim to drop the balls into specific pockets in the machine. If one of the balls, goes into the designated pocket, called STATO CHAKKA, it will initiate a slot machine like roll on the LCD screen. If the numbers or patterns line up, then it’s a jackpot. The winnings can be used to claim various prizes at the front desk, but cannot be claimed for cash directly since gambling is prohibited by Japanese law. Instead, the winnings can be exchanged into gold chips. Then outside at a neighboring TUC shop, the gold chips can be exchanged for cash.  NOTE: I hope that everyone is staying safe and healthy during these times. This video was filmed before Tokyo started recommending a city lockdown. In fact, at the time of uploading this video, Tokyo is still not officially on lockdown and residents are able to go out as they wish, but please know that I am staying at home these days as much as possible, eating meals at home and only venturing out for necessary items such as pregnancy clinic visits, grocery shopping, etc and also practicing social distancing as much as it is possible in Tokyo. And of course, I am not traveling these days.  この動画はコロナ対策：東京都外出自粛要請が出る前に撮影されたものとなります。 Watch more Japan Day in the Life Series (Playlist): - https://bit.ly/2FXYTwz Help support the channel and get my Toe-kyo Merch - https://tokyozebra.com/merch Check out My 2nd Channel - Tokyo Zebra - https://www.youtube.com/TokyoZebra Join my Paolo from TOKYO community site to get Answers to Questions about Japan schools, travels, etiquette, food, etc. and to connect and share information about Japan. - https://paolofrom.tokyo/discord Maruhan - https://www.maruhan.co.jp/english/about/ - https://goo.gl/maps/yQLdL8FC8pSQStZ19 Clarification Note: Maruhan Group has 23,000 Employees Maruhan Company has 12,230 Employees -- Channel Support --- Want to help SUPPORT my channel, buy me a BEER or Maiko and I DINNER?

This is a Toyota day in the life of a Japanese Auto Repair Shop worker, 30 year old, Erina.  This is also a Japanese office tour inside of a Japanese auto repair shop in Toyota. We start this very typical day in her Japanese home, commute via Toyota car to her Toyota car repair shop. This is a day in the life of Erina and we get to see her with co-workers and Japanese mechanics in how they work in Japan. This is a peak into Japanese work culture as well as the work culture in Japan. We see her typical working hours in Japan and how it is working in Japan as a female in her position also known as a Japanese office lady, Japanese OL or Japanese salary woman. Her day in the life in Japan may be a bit different than some Japanese salarymen, but her experiences in the office and auto repair shop is quite common for Japanese employees in her position. The Japanese auto repair shop is also pretty common in terms of work-life. If anythings, the car repair shop is a very traditional office in Japan with Rajio Taiso, cleaning and work ethic. So all in all, this is an example of Japan life as well as Japan countryside life if you were to work in a traditional Japanese company. You should always be aware of Japanese culture when working in a Japanese office.

Born in 2002 in Guinea Bissau, the teenager joined Barça at the age of 10, and has enjoyed a meteoric rise since then. The last two months have been his breakout: He made his debut on August 25 and has broken several records over the past 8 weeks. A lot can happen in 12 months. Just a year ago, Ansu Fati was part of the Under-18s A squad (with whom he is still registered). Now, he has become a regular part of squads in LaLiga and the Champions League. Here are some of the milestones that Ansu Fati has achieved over the past 67 days: Second youngest LaLiga debutant for Barça On August 25, 2019, Ansu Fati became the second youngest Barça player in history to debut in LaLiga. He was just 16 years and 298 days old when he made his first appearance. Only Vicente Martínez, who was 16 years, 9 months and 7 days old, debuted at a younger age. Ansu came on in the 78th minute to replace Carles Pérez in the 5-2 home win over Betis. Barça's youngest LaLiga goalscorer In the game against Osasuna at El Sadar, on August 31, Ansu Fati found the net for the first time. He was just 16 years and 304 days old at the time, The goal came from a cross by Pérez, and was Barça's first strike in a match that ended 2-2.  The youngest starter at the Camp Nou Ansu Fati's first start for Barça came on September 14, against Valencia. No player had ever been part of the first XI for the club at the Camp Nou at a younger age (16 years and 318 days). Youngest goalscorer and assist provider in a single league game In that same game against Valencia, a goal and an assist in the space of 7 minutes made Ansu Fati the youngest scorer and provider of all time in a single LaLiga match. (16 years and 318 days). Youngest goalscorer at the Camp Nou The goal made him the youngest man to get off the mark at the Camp Nou, be it for FC Barcelona or an away team (16 years and 318 days). Barça's youngest Champions League debutant An appearance in the Champions League aged 16 years and 321 days was another record for the forward, who made his European bow in a 59 minute appearance at Signal Iduna Park against Borussia Dortmund. Golden Boy and Globe Soccer Awards nominee Ansu Fati's breakthrough has led to him being nominated for both the Golden Boy (one of the 20 finalists for Under-20s player of the year), and the Globe Soccer Awards, where he is on a five-man shortlist for Best Newcomer. ---- FC Barcelona on Social Media Subscribe to our official channel http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=fcbarcelona Site: http://www.fcbarcelona.com Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/fcbarcelona Instagram: http://www.instagram.com Twitter: http://twitter.com/FCBarcelona Viber: http://chats.viber.com/fcbarcelona", "tags": "FC Barcelona, برشلونة،, Fútbol, FUTBOL, soccer, FUTEBOL, Sepakbola, サッカー, كرة القدم, football, FCB, Barça, Sport, Club, Barcelona, Camp, Nou, ansu, fati, training, goal, goals, ansumane, masia, skills, trip, delantero, cantera, planter, entrenamiento, gol, Inter, Milan, Champions, youngest, goalscorer, joleador, más, joven, 17", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A3PKIMMLxYQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUGTUlj3ccY", "title": "A day in my life with Fractured Foot | Surprises, Changes, Diet | Garima's Good Life", "description": "Hi Friends This is a day in my life with my fractured foot.

A full day following a Japanese Aerospace Engineer starting with him waking up in his Tokyo home with his Japanese family. Takashi is a Japanese husband and Japanese father taking care of his family in Japan. He lives in an average Japanese apartment in Tokyo and we get a peek into a day in his life in Japan. As a Japanese dad, he has a 4 year old Japanese kid and he balances his Japan worklife with Japan homelife. Takashi would be considered a Japanese salaryman as he has fairly standard working hours at Astroscale as a Space Engineer in Tokyo Japan.  on this day, we get to see his working hours in Japan. In addition to working on the ELSA-d project, he also has worked with JAXA on other missions. JAXA stands for Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and is the Japanese national aerospace and space agency. During the day, Takashi also visits Gitai, a space robotics company and meets with several Japanese robotics engineers. We even get a chance to explore the office and see Japanese built robots being designed for space.

The life of a typical Japanese Worker in the Cosplay world in Tokyo is different than the average Japanese salaryman. The average Japan working hours are completely different for the Japanese worker in Cosplay because of the job requirements are more flexible. Working in Japan can be grueling depending on the Job in Tokyo, but it can be more flexible if you decide. The Cosplayer life is a bit more free than the typical Japanese worker. This day in the life Japan cosplay video can highlight different opportunities working in Japan. There are manga cosplayer or anime cosplayer and it really depends on the Japan cosplayer interests. The cosplay life is not for most, but if you love it like Yuzuchi, a 20 year old Japanese female worker in Japan, then each day can be an enjoyable experience. The average Japanese working day for most salarymen starts between 8AM-9AM and finishes around 6PM - 7PM, but there is also a lot of Japanese overtime depending on the Japanese company. The Japanese worker in Cosplay, is able to start later in the day, but also works quite late as you will see in this video. This Japanese Cosplayer will visit a Japanese studio, meet with a friend for dinner and karaoke and also have late working hours for her online job.

This Japanese family shares their life in Japan and life in Tokyo for an entire day. We follow a Japanese mom and her soon to be 3 year old Japanese daughter inside their Tokyo home to see what they do in the morning all the way until the evening when they go to sleep. Tomomi, 38 years old and child, Karin almost 3 years old spend most of their day in their Tokyo apartment, but they also find some time to leave the house and go to the park. This Japanese family does many typical Japanese family things like make miso soup in the morning and make offering to their home shrine, but they also have their unique aspects of their life. They were kind enough to let us into their Japanese home to see what it is really like being raised in a Japanese home. This day in the life of mom and housewife, should give another perspective on how life in Japan would be if you lived here. I hope you enjoy this video.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, y el último track del disco, A Day In The Life, cierra el mismo con un acorde grandioso e interminable.

Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign please contact us at igg@simonscat.com Q. What software do you use? A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software. Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film? A. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film. Q. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise? A. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official web shop: https://shop.simonscat.com/", "tags": "simons cat, simon's cat, simonscat, simon tofield, simon the cat, funny cats, cute cats, cat fails, animated animals, short animation, animated cats, tofield, simon's katze, simon, cat, black and white, kitty, traditional animation, black and white cat, Кот Саймона, cat lovers, animal (film character), fail, funny cat, cats, cute, kitten, kittens, pets, simons cats, Cat, Simon, Tofield, Animated, Animation, Kitten, Funny, Humour, fun, videos", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fcjR93Jin4Y/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkkBU5-GjQ", "title": "Arsenal Ladies: A day in the life of Jordan Nobbs", "description": "Arsenal Ladies and England midfielder Jordan Nobbs gives an insight into her life off the pitch.

Dale click aquí: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWx8hTg8QRQ para ver chistes aún más graciosos =D El primer chiste es de un niño que es muy tonto y le pregunta a su papá por qué él es así, a que te ríes cuando veas qué le dice su padre. ¿Sabes por qué llora fideos? Si el escarabajo está cara arriba, ¿cómo le llamamos? ¡Jajajajaja! Y Memín sí que está bien tonto en este vídeo, se irá al sol de noche para no quemarse, qué bobo.  ¿Por qué Memín no puede hacer una suma bien mientras estudia con su papá? ¿Sabes por qué a la niña le dicen jabón en polvo? ¿Y qué le pegan una piedra al señor cuando va pasando por la escuela? ¿Y cuál es el colmo de un jardinero? ¡LOL! Todas estas preguntas pueden ser contestadas una vez hayas visto toooodo este vídeo con 85 chistes bien graciosos y de risa.  85 Chistes súper graciosos! Compilación de todos mis chistes del mes de noviembre 2016. Chistes de Memín, mamá mamá, escuela, mexicanos, tontos, bebés, gangosos, suegras y muchos más! Estos son TODOS mis chistes del mes QUE PASÓ (NOVIEMBRE 2016). Más de 80 chistes súper divertidos y chistosos 😝. Disfruta de más de 15 minutos de chistes, sin retos, sin dato curioso y sin saludos, ¡solo puros chistes! 😀.  Si viste todos mis vídeos del mes de NOVIEMBRE: todos los chistes de este vídeo están repetidos pero tal vez quieras volver a verlos todos juntos y sin pausa 😀. Prepárate a reír sin parar =)  Edad recomendada: Los Chistes contados por Beby son aptos para toda la familia (family friendly) pero recomendamos que sean vistos por niños de 13 años en adelante para poder entender algunas situaciones.

Set it aside. To a heated pot add the cooking oil, onion, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and fry on medium to medium high heat until the onion is soft and caramelized. Adding salt to onion/peppers will release it's moisture and help it cook faster, so don’t skip it.  Now reduce the heat to low and then add the ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenned and mix it. Right away the puree (we had made earlier) and give everything a good mix. Increase the heat to medium-low and bring it to a simmer. Once the puree starts to simmer, cover the lid and cook for about 12 minutes. You will notice specks of oil on top that means the puree is cooked perfectly.  Uncover and then add the chopped eggplant, green beans, firm tofu, coconut milk, water, salt and give it a good mix. Bring it to a boil. Once it starts to boil and cook for about another 10 minutes on medium heat or until the eggplant is cooked to your liking.  Uncover and give it a good mix. Now turn the heat to medium high to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes or to your desired consistency. Turn off the heat and give it one last mix. Serve hot with Rice, Naan or Roti. ▶️ IMPORTANT TIPS: 👉 Adding salt to onion will release it's moisture and will help it cook/caramelize faster, so please don’t skip this step 👉 Fry the onion until it’s nicely caramelized, this will add a lot of flavour to the dish 👉 Reduce the heat before adding the spices, it will prevent from burning 👉 Every stove is different, so adjust the cooking time and the heat of your stove accordingly Enjoy! ▶️ Subscribe To Channel For More Simple u0026 Healthy Plant Based Recipes For Any Day Of The Week: https://www.youtube.com/c/FoodImpromptu  ▶️ Stay Connected With Me.

Use code ERINROBINSON16 for up to 16 FREE MEALS + 3 Surprise Gifts across 6 HelloFresh boxes plus free shipping at https://bit.ly/3EohuNM We're back with another TIKTOK RECIPE TASTE TESTING MOMENT!! I decided to fill this one up with ALL of the recipes I could muster up in one day because my saves on TikTok we're getting a little out of control. From delicious cinnamon roll hacks to weird \"healthy coke\" nonsense, there is truly something for everyone in this video. Also, I am STILL on the hunt for the best cheese dip recipe out there, so please share below if you have one that has rocked your world. I've found a LOT of cheese dip recipes that are for sure GOOD but none that I want to cook more than once. So, let your cheese dip obsessions FLY in the comments below. Also, PLEASE chime in a tell me if you also tried this healthy coke TikTok trend and if I am the only one feels the way I do about it?  I'm including the recipe instructions down below. These were as detailed as I got from the TikTok recipes, so measure with your heart on these ingredients! HEALTHY COKE: balsamic vinegar and any sparkling water of your choice@bubly sparkling water canada  TIKTOK CINNAMON ROLLS - Start with Pillsbury cinnamon rolls u0026 you're going to lay those out on in a small baking dish. You're going to pour in enough heavy whipping cream to cover the rolls about halfway. The original recipe calls to cover them completely but I think that's too much. You're going to melt a stick of butter and mix in about a cup of brown sugar top with a dash of cinnamon and stir until that is all mixed together Then you're going to pour this mixture on top of the cinnamon rolls. Bake at 350 for 25-30 mins and keep your eye on them. Once they're out, you're going to use the icing that comes with the cinnamon rolls and smear it all over. 5 INGREDIENT DELICIOUS HEALTHY COOKIES - Start with 2 ripe bananas and mash those up in a mixing bowl, tip here is to not mash them too much like I did. Then you're going to add in 1/2 cup of peanut butter of your choice (but just so you know, the peanut butter spreads work better than the natural peanut butters for this recipe) and throw in a dash of vanilla. Next you're going to use raw oats, and fold in about a half cup of those and then mix well. Then you can add in a topping of your choice. Refrigerate the mixture for about 10 mins Sprinkle with sea salt...and bake at 350 for about 15 mins! 3 INGREDIENT MAC u0026 CHEESE - Shred at LEAST one block of cheddar cheese u0026 I also shredded some Colby Jack. Next add 6 ounces of elbow pasta u0026 then you're going to add in just enough water to cover the pasta and then you're going to get this boiling and once the pasta has cooked al dente and most of the water has been absorbed you're going to add in a can of evaporated milk..Then you're going to bring the mixture to a boil a second time. Then you're going to fold in that cheese. CHOPPED PROTEIN GRAIN BOWL- You're going to chop cabbage, a variety of bell peppers. You're also going to peel and chop fresh carrots, a jalapeño, some green onions, and radish. And you're going to take a minute to admire all of your hard work before you mix it all togetherThis recipe called for edamame but I bought the unpeeled kind and realized how much work it would be to peel it all so we just did a dash of edamame because I was exhausted after all that chopping. You're also going to toss in some roasted nuts. For the dressing, you're going to add some water, peanut butter, soy sauce, some fresh minced garlic and some white wine vinegar and you're going to combine all of that together to make your dressing. Taste it as you go so you can add things that it might be missing flavor wise PIZZA EGGS - Do I need to explain? Chop up a slice of your favorite pizza into tiny pieces. Toss in your eggs and scramble them together and you have pizza eggs. Extra credit if you toss in some truffle oil and MORE CHEESE! CROWD PLEASING CAULIFLOWER -Start by chopping up your cauliflower florets into bit size pieces and dice your pitted dates. Add your cauliflower to a pot with a drizzle of olive oil. Once the cauliflower browns, add chopped dates u0026 let those caramelize on medium heat. Toss in some pine-nuts, extra credit if you roasted them for a few mins prior to combining them.

Drain 1 can of black beans. Set the rice and beans aside to drain any excess water. (Use a Wider Pot to cook this dish, that way the rice can cook more evenly without getting mushy). To a heated pot add olive oil, red and green bell pepper, salt and fry on medium to medium high heat (depending on the heat of your stove) until the onions and pepper starts to caramelize. Adding salt to onion/peppers will release it's moisture and help it cook faster, so don’t skip it. Once the onion starts to caramelized add the strained tomatoes, ground cumin, paprika, cayenne and mix well. Add the washed rice, cooked black beans, corn kernels, salt, vegetable broth and mix well. Bring it to a boil and then cover and cook on low heat for about 15 minutes or until the rice is cooked (but not mushy). Uncover and turn off the heat. Add the chopped green onion, cilantro, lemon juice, black pepper, drizzle of olive oil and mix it very gently because rice is very soft at this point and over mixing can cause the rice grains to break. (NOTE: taste the rice before adding lemon juice and add lemon juice ONLY IF NEEDED) Cover and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. This recipe is perfect for meal planning and can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days. ▶️ IMPORTANT NOTES: - Use a Wider Pot to cook this dish, so that the rice can cook more evenly without getting mushy - Every stove is different so regulate the heat accordingly - The Cooking time depends on several factors - the type of pot being used, heat of the stove, moisture content of the ingredients etc. so please use your judgement and adjust the cooking time accordingly - Thoroughly wash the rice until the water runs clear to get rid of any impurities/gunk (it's an important step so please do not skip it) - This recipe is for white basmati rice, if you are using a different kind of rice adjust the water accordingly - Adding salt to onion/peppers will release it's moisture and will help it cook/caramelize faster, so please don’t skip this step - After adding the garnish, mix it very gently, rice is very soft at this point and this will prevent the rice grains from breaking - After mixing the garnish, cover the lid and let the rice sit for 5 minutes before serving - for the flavors to blend - taste the rice before adding lemon juice and add lemon juice ONLY IF NEEDED ******** ✅ Other Videos:  👉 Indian Lemon Fried Rice Recipe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zvHhtJWgVo  👉 Herb u0026 Lemon White Bean Potato Stew: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27_atY3R0fA  👉 Delicious White Bean Cauliflower Curry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5xu9uATBTg  👉Eggplant Chickpea Stew Recipe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td4H4X_MywY  ******** Welcome to the Official YouTube Channel of Food Impromptu!

MALPUA  Ingredients   1½ litres milk   50 grams mawa/khoya, grated  ½ cup refined flour (maida)  ½ teaspoon green cardamom powder  Ghee for shallow frying    For the sugar syrup 2 cups sugar  1 tbsp milk  A few saffron strands For garnishing 15-20 pistachios, blanched, peeled, and slivered    Method 1. Boil milk in a heavy-bottomed pan. Reduce heat and simmer till it is reduced and reaches a coating consistency. Add grated mawa and mix well. Bring it to room temperature. 2. Reserve two tablespoons of sugar and add the rest in a deep non-stick pan. Add 2 cups water and mix till the sugar melts. Place it over medium heat and cook till the mixture comes to a boil. 3. Add milk, mix, and collect the scum that forms on the surface and discard it. Add saffron and mix well. Continue to cook till the syrup reaches one string consistency. 4. Add the reserved sugar, refined flour, and green cardamom powder to the reduced milk. Mix well and make a batter of pouring consistency using a little milk if required.  5. Heat sufficient ghee in a wide flat-bottomed kadai. Pour a ladle full of batter to form a pancake. Cook on slow to medium heat. 6. Turn it over when it starts to colour slightly. When both sides are done, drain and immerse in the sugar syrup for 3-4 minutes. Drain and arrange on a serving plate.  7. Garnish with pistachios and serve hot. Chef’s tip: Serve hot Malpuas with chilled Rabdi. It tastes divine.

Shaoxing wine (料酒/绍酒), 1 tbsp * Reserved mushroom soaking liquid, 2 cups * Seasoning: sugar, 1/2 tsp; oyster sauce (蚝油), 1.5 tbsp * Slurry: cornstarch (生粉), 1/2 tbsp mixed with an equal amount of water - plus more, if needed * Salt to taste (we used 1/8 tsp of salt) Reconstitute the 8 mushrooms together with ~3 cups water. Next day, squeeze out the mushrooms, slice out the stems, reserve the liquid. Fry the ginger and the scallion whites. Up the flame to high, add in the mushrooms, fry, then swirl in the wine. Add in the soaking liquid, the seasoning, the the remainder of the scallion greens tied in a knot. Get up to a boil, down to a simmer, and simmer for 45 minutes - covered if in a wok, with the lid ajar if the lid is tight fitting. After 45 minutes, toss the aromatics. Transfer the mushrooms to a serving plate. You should have about 1 cup of liquid remaining, so thicken with a slurry until it's reached the right consistency - it should be *slightly* looser than nappe consistency, about as thick as a hot and sour soup. Season to taste, add back with the mushrooms. To use with noodles: boil some noodles – 60g dried per serving, 100g fresh per serving (recommended: 4 servings), and once cooked rinse with cool water to stop the cooking process. Oil each serving with ~1 tsp melted lard or toasted sesame oil. Top each serving with 1 tbsp of oyster sauce and 3-4 tbsp of sauce. Mix well. Garnish with scallion greens and serve together with the mushrooms. To use with vegetables: Boil your vegetables together with 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp oil. Serve the mushrooms and the sauce on top.

Season the chicken liberally with salt and pepper. Fry the chicken, skin side down, until the skin is golden and releases easily from the skillet, about 6 minutes. Flip the chicken over and continue to cook until it releases easily from the pan. Remove the chicken and set it aside. Add the peppers and shallot to the pan and cook until they have softened, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the beans and pesto. Cook until the beans have heated through. Return the chicken to the skillet and continue to cook, covered, until it reaches an internal temperature of 165ºF, about 5 minutes. Add a splash of water if the mixture is too dry. Serve the chicken immediately on top of the bean mixture or store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Mushroom Orecchiette https://inspiredentertainment.com/recipe/mushroom-orecchiette/ 1 pound dried orecchiette 1/4 cup butter 4 cups chopped mushrooms 5 garlic cloves, minced 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Salt and freshly cracked black pepper In a large pot of salted boiling water, add the pasta. Cook, stirring occasionally, according to package instructions. Be sure to reserve some of the pasta water before draining. Meanwhile, in a large Dutch oven or pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and season them with salt and pepper to taste. Cook the mushrooms until they have released their moisture and begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until it is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in a couple of ladles full of the pasta water. Add the pasta to the skillet and cook until it is heated through. Once heated, Stir in the parsley. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.  Shrimp u0026 Snap Peas 3 tablespoons miso paste 1/4 cup water 1 pound peeled shrimp 4 garlic cloves 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 2 cups snap peas In a small bowl, whisk together the miso paste and water until smooth. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook until it begins to turn pink, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger and cook until they become fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in the miso sauce and the snap peas. Continue to cook, stirring until the shrimp is cooked through and the snap peas are tender crisp, about 1 minute. Serve immediately over some rice or store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. #Dinner #Recipes #Cooking  *SOME links provided above are affiliate links  The Domestic Geek is Hosted by Sara Lynn Cauchon", "tags": "30 minute meals, 5 ingredient meals, 5 ingredient dinner, 30 minute dinner, 10 minute dinner, dinner recipes, healthy dinner recipes, fast dinner recipes, inexpensive dinner recipes, shrimp recipe, shrimp dinner, pasta dinner recipe, chicken and white beans, mushroom pasta recipe, veggie pasta, vegetarian pasta recipe, The Domestic Geek, The Domestic Geek Pasta, Sara Lynn Cauchon, Dinner Made Easy, Healthy Recipes, Easy Cooking, How to cook dinner, Family dinner recipes", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BrDidX-dhBM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPM8MxcAmkU", "title": "Trying Recipes Gordon Ramsay Hates • Peanut Butter Steak", "description": "Hello friends! And welcome back to this channel! This week we’re gonna be trying out a recipe (or dare I say, \"hack\") that Gordon Ramsay has gone absolutely ballistic over on his TikTok: a T-Bone steak slathered in peanut butter.

Yes, we know this is not how you're supposed to cook an actual steak, and yes, we know that the peanut butter jar we used is already contaminated even though we didn't spoon the stuff from the pan back in the jar! We had to retire the jar after this video.

There is a meaning to the ingredients: Marzipan is made from bittersweet almonds, sugar, and rosewater. Almond and sugar symbolize the ups and downs of a marriage: Facing and overcoming the bitter times and also enjoying the good times together. The rosewater symbolizes the love in the relationship.  Nuts symbolize prosperity in some regions, so nuts in the wedding cake are often a must. In my case, I went easy on the nuts because my daughter doesn't like them and I wanted everyone to eat this cake.

IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR LABEL, PLEASE VISIT EBAY AND BUY A LABEL PROTECTOR. This is the manual cleaning instructions for use with TERGIKLEEN™ record cleaner. Using simple inexpensive tools, one is able to get pro-quality cleaning results on all your old and new vinyl records. Our product is incapable of doing any harm to your records, it contains Tergitol™ which has been used for decades by the Library of Congress, the Canadian Archival Institute, DJ’s, and record collectors.  There are many record cleaning products out there, but none of them is going to restore groove damage in vinyl recordings. There is no “magic” cleaner that can do that. What you DO want, is a cleaning solution that is going to do a superior job of removing dust, dirt, cigarette smoke residue, oils, waxes, fingerprints etc. TERGIKLEEN does precisely that with no questionable additives, no alcohol, no ammonia or glass cleaners or dish washing detergents. These things can and WILL damage your records forever.  If you are just using an old “record player” with heavy tone arm and low quality stereo you may not hear the damage you are doing thru these kinds of systems, with \"do-it-yourself\" cleaning fluids. These old machines and the cheap Chinese machines now flooding the market will not produce audiophile level sound, and they will damage your records thru heavy cartridges and tone arms with cheap, and worn stylus needles. TERGIKLEEN is for those who want the best and most safe cleaning product, with modern, maintained turntables and good quality stereo systems. Great sounds from classic recordings can best be enjoyed by properly set up turntables, with light weight cartridges and tone arms that won’t damage audio information in delicate grooves. Alcohol, and dish detergents and the other crazy substances you read about on the internet will produce audible damage to your records, particularly in the high frequencies such as cymbals and vocal “s” sounds, turning them into harsh sand paper noise. TERGIKLEEN is incapable of doing this kind of damage, and we make no “miracle” claims other than it will remove pretty much everything from your record surface that should not be there.  Record cleaning machines are a godsend for those who want to clean alot of records quicker than this manual method, and we have videos on each type of machine, with tips and instructions how to use all of them.

However, advances in the polymer field have enabled manufacturers to create a product that performs vastly better than its predecessors. \"It was mainly on the back burner because nobody really understood it,\" says Gelinas. \"The fact that polymer technology has changed pretty drastically has given us the ability to encapsulate better.\" Encapsulation evolved from carpet soaps that were notorious for causing resoiling of carpets, says Mark Warner, national sales manager for The Bullen Cos., Inc., and brand manager for Clausen Carpet Solutions, Folcroft, Pa. There have been several modifications to the technology that have served as the basis for today's encapsulator. Warner says these advancements include: • The addition of a compound known as Ludox. This filled the grooves within fibers to prevent soiling. While that was an improvement, it caused other problems, such as interfering with the carpet's ability to refract light, resulting in unattractive carpets. • The development of detergent encapsulation that used butyl as an active solvent, in order to enhance the rinsability of the cleaning chemical. It was an improvement, but still led to resoiling. • In the 1980s, chemists began addressing the resoiling problem by adding acrylic co-polymers — similar to those in floor finish. This allowed the solutions to dry to a crystalline material for easier vacuuming. It was a vast improvement over previous products, but it also led to problems such as residue, and the inability to remove product without using a stripper. • About 10 years ago, fluorocarbon chemistry was introduced, which left a \"Teflon-like\" substance on the fiber which allowed dirt and soil to slide off of the fiber. This \"second generation\" of encapsulation concerned the government because of the long-term health effects of fluorocarbons. It also attracted moisture from the atmosphere, which made the carpet feel slimy or greasy. • Over the past couple of years, a \"third generation\" of encapsulation has emerged that uses entirely new solvents and surfactants that dry down into a powder on their own, without the need for other additives such as acrylic copolymer embrittlement agents.

Sin embargo, en los últimos años el currículo y el ambiente de las escuelas han afectado negativamente el desarrollo del estudiante, la autoestima, el presente y el futuro de nuestros niños, estudiantes y profesionales. Aunque hay muchos desafíos negativos, hay personas sorprendentes descubriendo nuevas formas de educar correctamente. Al no cambiar no nos estamos comprometiendo... PARTE 1 Visitamos 14 países, de los cuales cuatro tenían los mejores sistemas educativos del mundo, incluyendo a Finlandia, Singapur, Corea del Sur y Estados Unidos. Otros de los países que visitamos fueron Bolivia, Colombia y México. Descubrimos que aunque los países del primer mundo tienen una mejor educación, no se preocupan por el estado emocional de los estudiantes que se deteriora y conduce al alcoholismo y al suicidio. Independientemente del estado económico de un país, el bullying sigue siendo un problema y como resultado de que los educadores no pueden combatir esta cuestión, más de 350.000 estudiantes se suicidan anualmente. PARTE 2 Entrevistamos a los mejores neurocientíficos y expertos en educación para recabar opiniones sobre la mejor manera de arreglar la estructura educativa de nuestro sistema escolar para las generaciones futuras. PARTE 3 Mostramos a las mejores personas y escuelas que están haciendo cosas increíbles para inspirar a nuestros niños, jóvenes y futuros profesionales. Mostramos la forma correcta y posible de la educación.

Dharmesh Sheth spoke as part of the 12pm edition of 'Transfer Centre' to provide the latest updates on this story. #SkySportsNews #SkySports #manchesterunited  ► For the latest transfer news: https://qrcode.skysports.com/skysports/deadlineday   More from Sky Sports on YouTube: ► Sky Sports Retro: http://bit.ly/SkySportsRetroSub ► Sky Sports: http://bit.ly/SkySportsSub ► Sky Sports Football: http://bit.ly/SSFootballSub ► Sky Sports Boxing: http://bit.ly/SSBoxingSub ► Sky Sports F1: http://bit.ly/SubscribeSkyF1 ► Sky Sports Cricket: http://bit.ly/SubscribeSkyCricket ► Sky Sports Golf: https://bit.ly/SubscribeSkySportsGolf ► To enquire about licensing Sky Sports News content, you can find out more here: https://www.skysports.com/more-sports/news/31754/11434270/license-sky-sports-footage", "tags": "Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldo, Cristiano, CR7, Manchester United, Man United, Transfer, Sky Sports News, Sky Sports, Sky Sports Football, News, Sport News, Breaking News, Football News, Transfer News, Atletico Madrid, Atletico, Madrid, Bayern Munich, Bayern, Munich, Protest, Fans, Supporters, La Liga, Bundesliga, Premier League, Frenkie De Jong", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A5R3dICBJJo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tTUh7goxpg", "title": "\"I'm not satisfied, totally not\" | Erik ten Hag reacts to his first Man Utd loss of the season!", "description": "SUBSCRIBE ► https://bit.ly/SubscribeSkySportsPL PREMIER LEAGUE HIGHLIGHTS ► http://bit.ly/SkySportsPLHighlights2223 Erik ten Hag speaks after ​​​​​Pascal Gross's first-half double gave Brighton a surprise 2-1 win at Man Utd as Erik ten Hag's reign got off to the worst possible start.

Both clubs have made the 30-year-old appealing offers - but United's is thought to be more financially lucrative. Eriksen worked with Erik ten Hag when he trained with Ajax as part of his his return to football following his horrifying collapse while playing for Denmark at Euro 2020. Teaming up again as part of United's anticipated new era has its attractions. But sources close to the midfielder, whose short-term contract at Brentford expires at the end of June, say he and his family are settled in London and have reservations about relocating to the North West. Eriksen also wants to start every game to be sure of a place in Denmark's World Cup team later this year - his priority after missing out on the Euros because of his cardiac arrest in the first game. #SkySportsNews #SkySports #manchesterunited  ► For the latest transfer news: https://qrcode.skysports.com/skysports/deadlineday   More from Sky Sports on YouTube: ► Sky Sports Retro: http://bit.ly/SkySportsRetroSub ► Sky Sports: http://bit.ly/SkySportsSub ► Sky Sports Football: http://bit.ly/SSFootballSub ► Sky Sports Boxing: http://bit.ly/SSBoxingSub ► Sky Sports F1: http://bit.ly/SubscribeSkyF1 ► Sky Sports Cricket: http://bit.ly/SubscribeSkyCricket ► Sky Sports Golf: https://bit.ly/SubscribeSkySportsGolf ► To enquire about licensing Sky Sports News content, you can find out more here: https://www.skysports.com/more-sports/news/31754/11434270/license-sky-sports-footage", "tags": "Christian Eriksen, Manchester United, Brentford, Sky Sports News, Transfer Talk, Paul Pogba, Juventus", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SnWuiAxgNx4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkeCUTWzn4", "title": "sport news | RADIO COMUNICA", "description": "Cada uno tiene una historia memorable así como figuras que lo inmortalizaron: marcadores, estadísticas, comentarios y más para los amantes del deporte.", "tags": "RADIO COMUNICA, sport news, deportes, noticias, radio, programa, futbol, transmision, the lonely nation", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vBkeCUTWzn4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hmCKXLaHk0", "title": "Will Romelu Lukaku's move from Inter Milan go down as the worst transfer in Premier League history?", "description": "► Subscribe to Sky Sports News: http://bit.ly/SkySportsNewsSub Melissa Reddy, Dharmesh Sheth and Kaveh Solhekol discussed potential ingoings and outgoings at Chelsea as part of today's Transfer Talk.

Since this is my first video please pardon me if it is too short and lame. This video consist of : 1) My recommendation for the best youtube channel to refer to for The Hindu Analysis. 2) My recommendation for the best youtube channel to refer to for The Economics time Analysis and concept clearance. 3) Clouds timelapse. 4) Most importantly food shorts. 5) Book Recommendation. Also, in the future, I will try to give more recommendations and tips, and tricks to use for effective learning and some more knowledge and study resources for people preparing for CAT, CMAT, MAT, XAT, NMAT, SNAP, ATMA and GMAT, and MAH CET.

What if you could study better and save time? Well, the study tips covered in this video will teach you how to study effectively. I traveled to top schools including, Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley, and MIT to find the best studying tips. Put them to good use! I think the general themes are Review and Repetition and Asking for Help. Review RIGHT after class and do not postpone. This will help you memorize your notes faster because you'll know exactly you wrote right after class. The other theme is Repetition. This is the core of studying...there are many ways you can try to speed up your repetition. For example, Ananya said she uses a study technique called \"Spaced Repetition.\" This strategy is to ensure that you don't waste time studying things you already know. Lastly, go to your professors' office hours! Or talk to older college students who've taken the class before. This way, you'll know what to focus on and what to skip. It'll save you a lot of time.

Are you as efficient and productive as you can be? High school junior Yana Savitsky shares how the Pomodoro method changed the way she thinks and acts towards her work, allowing her to make the most of her time and achieve her goals. Yana Savitsky is a sophomore at Lake Forest High School. Taking rigorous academic courses at the AP and honors level, she is constantly flooded with strenuous assignments. Outside of academics, however, Yana has a passion for storytelling and helping others, whether it is visually, through the lens of a camera in New Media, or speaking out for social change and volunteering. Nonetheless, Yana seeks to efficiently and effectively complete her coursework, and even excel in it through maximizing her time with the Pomodoro Method, conveniently the topic of her TED talk.

Welcome to the family~ 🟣 MY JOURNEY AS A SLOW LEARNER In primary school, most of my time was taken up by sports, mainly rhythmic gymnastics. At one point, I even competed to represent my state and was training for 9 to 12 hours a week. That meant that I definitely prioritised sports over my studies. However, I sustained a back injury at 12 years old during a rhythmic gymnastics competition and so all my sporting activities ended there. In secondary school, I had no more training and so I had nothing else to do other than study but because I had neglected my studies for so many years, I did not have any idea on HOW to study. I had no guidance, no study tips and definitely no Youtube tutorials. So I really struggled A LOT. My foundation in mathematics and languages were terrible, and I was not understanding concepts as quickly as my friends. It was super frustrating but more devastatingly, it wrecked my confidence. Over the years, I discovered my own quirky little study tips. Now, not only have I caught up, but one of my favourite things to do is learn about anything and everything. I love watching documentaries and picking up new skills in my free time. I can also learn new things very quickly now. So the purpose of me telling you this is to let you know that it is completely possible to improve. It is also normal to feel frustrated but you need to tell yourself to not give up and to move at your own pace. I mean, the tortoise did win the race right? Not the hare ;) —— 🟣 S U B S C R I B E: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsJfDna-9xsG-NmM0kwgEkg?view_as=subscriber 🟣 I N S T A G R A M: https://www.instagram.com/ngfayee 🟣 E M A I L (business inquires and fan art ONLY): thengfaye@gmail.com  🟣 LINK TO MY DISCORD: https://discord.gg/P3jaZFBuKZ Discord is a place where: 1) We do study livestreams almost everyday 2) We can share study tips and advice for school/uni/college/mental health 3) We can chit-chat —— 🔵T I M E S T A M P S 0:00 Intro 0:58 STUDY TIP 1: What to do when you come across a new topic or concept 2:40 Skillshare class recommendation 3:38 STUDY TIP 2a: How to manage your time 4:26 STUDY TIP 2b: How to remember more information 5:16 STUDY TIP 3: How to effectively and quickly revise your material 6:36 STUDY TIP 4: What to do when you feel lost 8:47 STUDY TIP 6: YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS 9:15 STUDY TIP 7: the BEST ADVICE for you  —— 🟠P R O D U C T  L I N K S CLICK THE LINK ➡️ CLICK \"ADD TO CART\" [🌟 = highly recommend] Ring Binders used for my notes 🌟 https://shp.ee/6qrwn8n Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse 🌟 [MY; set] https://shp.ee/xne4i7f [International; keyboard] https://amzn.to/2RGayJn [International; mouse] https://amzn.to/3adXlxI  iPad Case (protects iPad and Apple Pencil) 🌟 [MY] https://shp.ee/iw2v8z2 [International] https://amzn.to/3mNqO6y [International; more colours] https://amzn.to/32huuEs ipad Bag (same as mine but MUCH cheaper) 🌟 [MY] https://shp.ee/bwvekbi [MY] [International] https://amzn.to/32eiMKA IPad Stand [MY] https://shp.ee/5py2ufr [International] https://amzn.to/2QoQgn0  Laptop Stand (mine is rose gold) 🌟 [MY] https://shp.ee/56sey2s [International] https://amzn.to/3dkd7sL Laptop Case [MY] https://shp.ee/bav4eqf [International] https://amzn.to/32ep24T ——— 🟠A MESSAGE FOR YOU Thank you for your overwhelming support.

Boost your study performance with strategies recommended by science - The ANSWER Method. These tips are for high school or university students preparing for exams or wanting to learn more effectively. For free downloadable posters about these six strategies for effective learning, click this link - https://www.dropbox.com/s/sofzb2m3sqzwvlv/6%20Strategies%20for%20Effective%20Learning.pdf?dl=1 This video is a collaboration between The Learning Scientists (http://www.learningscientists.org/) and Memorize Academy (https://www.memorize.academy).  EXAMPLES of specific Elaboration questions from MATH You're studying calculus. The topic is “derivatives”. How do derivatives work? Well, they are the rate of the change. How does that work? You take a look at one point, then you take a look at a prior point, over some interval. And then you take the difference divided by the interval. As that interval approaches zero, you have the instantaneous rate of change. Why does this happen? Because “instantaneous” means that the interval is nothing. SCIENCE Imagine you are studying neural communication, maybe in a biology, neuroscience, or psychology class.  How does neural communication work? If we look at one neuron, the dendrites receive messages from many other neurons, and then the messages converge in the soma. If there is enough of a positive charge within the soma, then an action potential will occur, and an electrical signal goes down the axon. When the signal reaches the terminal buttons, neurotransmitters release into the synapse where they communicate with the dendrites of the next neuron. Why does this happen? The neurotransmitters are chemicals that allow neurons to communicate with one another. The pattern of activation among different neurons (which neurons fire, how quickly, what neurotransmitters they release) determines the message in your brain.  You might then ask, how does the axon work? The axon is a long tail-like structure that produces the electrical signal.  How does the signal travel? The axon is covered in myelin sheath, a fatty substance that insulates the axon. The myelin sheath works like the rubber around the cord of an electrical appliance, and it serves to make the electricity travel faster. Why have myelin sheath? Because we need our neurons to be able to send signals fast, since we need to be able to react, make decisions, move quickly, perceive feeling in our skin instantly, etc. Make sure to compare ideas to learn how they are similar and different. For example, an axon and terminal buttons are both parts of a neuron; but, the axon sends an electrical signal while the terminal buttons release chemicals. Both Schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease are related to the neurotransmitter dopamine, but Schizophrenia is the result of too much dopamine while Parkinson’s disease is the result of too little dopamine.  Also, try to make connections to your own memories or experiences, and compare ideas to learn how they are similar and different. We already made the connection from myelin sheath on axons to the rubber on cords to electrical appliances.  Here is another example: a family member or close friend who suffers from Schizophrenia disease is suffering from too much dopamine. This means that too much dopamine is being released, by the terminal buttons, into the synapse. A doctor could give them a drug to reduce the dopamine in their brain, called a dopamine antagonist. If too much of this drug is used, the patient might begin developing symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease.  How would a dopamine antagonist work? … continue asking yourself elaborative questions! HISTORY Imagine you’re studying World War II, and the attack on Pearl Harbor.  You could ask yourself, how did this attack happen? On December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the United States Naval Base at Pearl Harbor. The attack included Japanese fighter planes, bombers, and torpedo planes.  Why did this happen? The Japanese intended to destroy the United States’ Pacific Fleet so that it could not interfere with Japanese operations.  Here you could also ask another type of question: What was the result of this historic event? Well, Japanese casualties were light, while they damaged eight U.S. Navy battleships. The Arizona was among those that the Japanese sunk, and was not raised from the shallow water. U.S. aircrafts were also destroyed, and 2,403 Americans were killed (1,178 were injured).  Why is this event important? The day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his Infamy Speech, the United States declared war on Japan, and Japanese-Americans were then relocated to internment camps.  You could then go on: how did the U.S. enter the war? How did the Pearl Harbor attack lead up to the release of the atomic bomb? How did the war end? And so on. There are so many ways to explain the idea and add details!", "tags": "kyle buchanan, memorize academy, whiteboard animation memory coach, how to study, study skills, how to study effectively, best way to study, study methods, the answer method, study tips, study techniques, study strategies, how to study for a test, how to study in college, how to study for finals, study habits, good study habits, how to learn, learning scientists, how to learn 10x faster, how to memorize 10x faster, how to memorize fast and easily", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CPxSzxylRCI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98d2Sx3HzwQ", "title": "Best study tips for students", "description": "Learning sometimes requires us to see things through a different lens.

Anyone can do it? The question is what makes you do it? Isme hamne deepak goyal ki story dekhi ki 8th class tak unhe sab loser maante the lekin jis waqt unhe pata chal gaya ki log unhe respect karte hai agar unke ache marks aayenge. To unhone study karna start kar diya aur IIT me selection bhi hui saath me aaj itni badi company ke founder bhi hai. To iska matlab hai ki capability to sab me hai bas hame ye find karna padega ki ham khud ko kya reward de sakte hai taaki ham khud se kaam karva sake. Second point tha Don’t drain your energy:- isme hamne american scater aur 2022 olympic winner Nathan Chen ki story dekhi ki olympics ke time me vo apna mobile ghar hi chor ke aaye the. Vo jaante the is se unki energy drain hogi. Aur aap kisi ko bhi apne aas paas bhi notice kar lena jo life me kuch bada achieve kar rahe hai ya to vo bilkul bhi social media me nhi honge yaa bhaut hi selective time ke liye use karte honge. Dekho yaar jab bhi notifications aayengi to hamari energy drain hogi hi hogi..chahe phir notifications ko drain karne me hi kyu na ho isiliye jab ham preperation kar rahe hai us waqt to ise band hi karna padega. Next point tha To learn you have to teach.:- Isme hamne dekha tha..ki Mohnish Pabrai jaise master investors is principle par itna vishwaas karte hai ki sirf is principle ko follow karne ke liye unhone apna youtube channel bhi khol diya. Kyunki vo jaante hai kisi ko 10% knowledge dene ke liye bhi unhe 100% preperation karni padegi ye bhi ek acha hack hai khud se mehnat karvaane ka. Focus is for 5 minutes and not for hours:- isme hamne policy bazaar Yashish Dhaiya ki story dekhi thi ki kaise pehle unka bhi focus nhi banta tha aur isiliye classs me bhi unhe teachers chalk faink ke daant te the.. But unhone khud se kaam karvaane ke liye ek trick ka sahara liya aur vo ye thi ki mein agle 5 minute ke liye khoob mehnat karunga focused way se study karunga.. Aur aise hi 5 -5 minute kar ke vo roz ke 6-7 gate nikaal lete the. Aur isi strategy se unhone iit aur iim jaise mushkil exams bhi clear ka liye. Next point tha Does pomodoro technique works. To iska answer hamne dekha tha ki yes bhi hai aur no bhi. Yes isiliye hai ki apni performance badhaane ke liye hame break lena hi padega. Agar pure thak ke break lenge to zaada output nhi de paayenge. Lekin kya exactly 25 minute ya 50 minute ke baad break lena hai? To ye koi maths ka formula nhi hai.. Ise ham khud ke mind aur body ko dekh ke samajh sakte hai. Aur uske according break le sakte hai. I hope ye video aapko valuable laga hoga JAI HIND.. I hope these hope these 3 resources will help you.

Sometimes you may have to study alone or remotely and this can seem like a lonely experience but you're not on your own - our top tips are here to motivate you. Watch this video to find out six top tips to help you when you have to study alone. Then visit our website and test your understanding in our quiz: http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/english-you-need/unit-19/session-1 [Images: Getty Images] Transcript Rob Sometimes you may have to study alone or remotely and this can seem like a lonely experience. But you're not on your own - our top tips are here to motivate you. Firstly, you need to choose the right place to study – create a dedicated study space and the right environment for learning and remove any distractions. Now think about when you'll use this space – organise your time effectively and make a timetable. Choose the right time of day to study – but don't overdo it and know when to stop and take a break! Listen to what this student does… Student I was terrible at time management at first but I've learnt to get organised and write down every appointment I have and every task I have to do in the diary. This allows me to plan my week. I also stick a list of goals I have to achieve each week on the wall. When I complete them I cross them off. Rob Studying alone can be boring so you need make things fun – use a range of learning materials and techniques and especially interactive materials online. You can feel isolated when working alone so try to join a local study group where you can talk to other students. If that's not possible, join an online group. You can also make friends and keep in touch by email, chat rooms or video calls. Of course, ideally it's good to learn face-to-face with someone so maybe there's a friend you can meet to study with? Or perhaps you can join a local language school? Finally, when you need help you need to know where to go. Make sure the course you're studying has someone you can contact to ask questions and get clarification. Just remember, you're not completely on your own when you study alone!

Boost your study performance with strategies recommended by science - The ANSWER Method. These tips are for high school or university students preparing for exams or wanting to learn more effectively. For free downloadable posters about these six strategies for effective learning, click this link - https://www.dropbox.com/s/sofzb2m3sqzwvlv/6%20Strategies%20for%20Effective%20Learning.pdf?dl=1 This video is a collaboration between The Learning Scientists (http://www.learningscientists.org/) and Memorize Academy (https://www.memorize.academy).  EXAMPLES of specific Elaboration questions from MATH You're studying calculus. The topic is “derivatives”. How do derivatives work? Well, they are the rate of the change. How does that work? You take a look at one point, then you take a look at a prior point, over some interval. And then you take the difference divided by the interval. As that interval approaches zero, you have the instantaneous rate of change. Why does this happen? Because “instantaneous” means that the interval is nothing. SCIENCE Imagine you are studying neural communication, maybe in a biology, neuroscience, or psychology class.  How does neural communication work? If we look at one neuron, the dendrites receive messages from many other neurons, and then the messages converge in the soma. If there is enough of a positive charge within the soma, then an action potential will occur, and an electrical signal goes down the axon. When the signal reaches the terminal buttons, neurotransmitters release into the synapse where they communicate with the dendrites of the next neuron. Why does this happen? The neurotransmitters are chemicals that allow neurons to communicate with one another. The pattern of activation among different neurons (which neurons fire, how quickly, what neurotransmitters they release) determines the message in your brain.  You might then ask, how does the axon work? The axon is a long tail-like structure that produces the electrical signal.  How does the signal travel? The axon is covered in myelin sheath, a fatty substance that insulates the axon. The myelin sheath works like the rubber around the cord of an electrical appliance, and it serves to make the electricity travel faster. Why have myelin sheath? Because we need our neurons to be able to send signals fast, since we need to be able to react, make decisions, move quickly, perceive feeling in our skin instantly, etc. Make sure to compare ideas to learn how they are similar and different. For example, an axon and terminal buttons are both parts of a neuron; but, the axon sends an electrical signal while the terminal buttons release chemicals. Both Schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease are related to the neurotransmitter dopamine, but Schizophrenia is the result of too much dopamine while Parkinson’s disease is the result of too little dopamine.  Also, try to make connections to your own memories or experiences, and compare ideas to learn how they are similar and different. We already made the connection from myelin sheath on axons to the rubber on cords to electrical appliances.  Here is another example: a family member or close friend who suffers from Schizophrenia disease is suffering from too much dopamine. This means that too much dopamine is being released, by the terminal buttons, into the synapse. A doctor could give them a drug to reduce the dopamine in their brain, called a dopamine antagonist. If too much of this drug is used, the patient might begin developing symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease.  How would a dopamine antagonist work? … continue asking yourself elaborative questions! HISTORY Imagine you’re studying World War II, and the attack on Pearl Harbor.  You could ask yourself, how did this attack happen? On December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the United States Naval Base at Pearl Harbor. The attack included Japanese fighter planes, bombers, and torpedo planes.  Why did this happen? The Japanese intended to destroy the United States’ Pacific Fleet so that it could not interfere with Japanese operations.  Here you could also ask another type of question: What was the result of this historic event? Well, Japanese casualties were light, while they damaged eight U.S. Navy battleships. The Arizona was among those that the Japanese sunk, and was not raised from the shallow water. U.S. aircrafts were also destroyed, and 2,403 Americans were killed (1,178 were injured).  Why is this event important? The day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his Infamy Speech, the United States declared war on Japan, and Japanese-Americans were then relocated to internment camps.  You could then go on: how did the U.S. enter the war? How did the Pearl Harbor attack lead up to the release of the atomic bomb? How did the war end? And so on. There are so many ways to explain the idea and add details!", "tags": "kyle buchanan, memorize academy, whiteboard animation memory coach, how to study, study skills, how to study effectively, best way to study, study methods, the answer method, study tips, study techniques, study strategies, how to study for a test, how to study in college, how to study for finals, study habits, good study habits, how to learn, learning scientists, how to learn 10x faster, how to memorize 10x faster, how to memorize fast and easily", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CPxSzxylRCI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTWgE1sut5g", "title": "Study Tips EVERY University Student Needs to Hear 2021!", "description": "University Study/Organisation Tips u0026 Advice #university #studytips -------------------------------------------------- SOCIAL MEDIA Instagram - http://instagram.com/derinadetosoye Twitter - https://twitter.com/derinadetosoye Snapchat: heyderin -------------------------------------------------- ATTENTION COMPANIES: If you would like me to review a product, collaborate with me or have any enquires, email me at: beautybyderin@gmail.com -------------------------------------------------- TECH INFO Camera - Canon 700D Vlogging Camera - iPhone 8+ Editing - Final Cut Pro X -------------------------------------------------- DISCLAIMER FTC: This video is not sponsored! :)", "tags": "derin adetosoye, beautybyderin, university, college, study tips, how to study, student, school, smart, how to, graduation, study, education, studying, students, how to get good grades, how to study for finals, learning, exams, high school, test, exam, science, learn, notes, intelligent, study methods, tips, good study habits, moving, essentials, sixth form, beginning, uni, degree, advice", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rTWgE1sut5g/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BumNUlYRvf4", "title": "realistic study tips for procrastinating weebs (i'm talking to you)", "description": "Some realistic advice on how to get into ultra instinct exam revision mode and motivate yourself to study.

Simplifying notes: I learned this way too late in life, but simplifying notes not only makes them more effective in how they structure relevant information and key points, but the act of using less complex means to write notes boosts your attention in class, allows you to write more and summarize as you go. I have a full video on how I now take simplified notes. I’ve been using this method for almost one year and I never had batches of notes as good as these.r 2. Making study guides for dummies: a study guide is a life saver before an exam, but a study guide for dummies is even better. These are notes that only you are going to read. Simplifying the language, inserting obvious references and ridiculous examples will improve memory retention and create connections between concepts that otherwise would be too obscure to explain.r 3. Finding a study buddy: a study buddy is that person you can rely on to exchange notes, discuss a difficult concept or practice mock up tests with. It’s someone that will accompany you through the studying process and will have your back during those crucial weeks before finals. Even for the most introverted person, finding a study buddy will help you through your class or who know, the entirety of your college years.r r 4. Simplifying your planning system: this is another thing that I learned late in life, but having one thousand apps doing the same thing or changing between five different planners will do you more harm than good. Make sure your planning system is only divided into 1) events, 2) tasks and 3)long-term planning and chose the appropriate tools to prevent you from deviating and getting more planning tools than you actually need.r 5. Finding a distraction-free environment: a distraction-free environment can mean different things for different people, but the goal here is to avoid the things that prevent you from being in a focused state. For instance, I can be perfectly focused in an environment with a lot of people and noise but I can’t, for the life of me, stay focused if I’m feeling the slightest bit cold. Find the factors that impact your concentration levels and try to reduce them as much as possible.r 6. Going beyond usual study materials and getting involved with the topic: this is one of those study tips that not everyone has the time to do (because sometimes life is just hectic) but if you do have the time for this, I can guarantee it will help you in a way that almost no other study tip will help you. Conducting research on a topic in your own way, creating your own methods for investigating a certain question or concept, finding articles and textbooks outside of the traditional scope will enhance your learning process a lot and create a whole background for the things you’ve learned in the past that you couldn’t get any other way. r 7. Mock presentations before tests u0026 exams: these can take a huge chunk of your time but they probably replace two or three revisions. Doing a mock presentation on a subject or pretending like you’re explaining a topic out loud to a friend forces you to process information in a completely different way, using less formal words and sentences and most of all, connect the relevant information to convey a message or an idea instead of memorizing for the sake of memorizing. r 8. Create reading reports - a so called reading report is basically a summary of the information present in a book, article or other document. It allows you to focus on the most important ideas and arguments outlines by the author and draw a conclusion. For classes that really heavily on reading, this is a great way to create a review and your own interpretation of the lectured information and have everything neatly compiled in a folder.r 9. Prepare classes with the expectation of being called: preparing your classes believing your are going to participate is a great way to make sure you’re not forgetting any of the essentials and delve well into the topic that is being lectures. I tried to do this as much as possible back in law school and those were definitely the classes where I had the best results in my final exams. The amount of active preparation throughout the semester ensures that all of that material is consolidated by the end of your term. r 10. Start studying for tests and exams two to three weeks in advance: studying one or two days before an exam or an important test was a sure way to have a mediocre grade. I tried as much as possible to organize my study and using a calendar to divide chapters per days or weeks and cover all of the information calmly before my exam arrived.r F T C : This video is sponsored by Audible.", "tags": "video, compartir, teléfono con cámara, teléfono con video, gratuito, subir", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Et71Bzrmoe4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo8Sh8Tx3is", "title": "Organization + Study Tips for High School!", "description": "Don't forget to thumbs up this video!!(: Check out my blog: http://charmbeauty111.com/ Twitter: (CharmBeauty111) https://twitter.com/CharmBeauty111 Instagram: (_imaaanixo) http://instagram.com/_imaaanixo Song: Roar - Ali Brustofski (Cover) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afUWccsC68A", "tags": "B2S Organization & Study Tips, Clothes Haul, How to get Good Grades, High school, Back to School, B2S, exams, finals, organization, study, study tips, CharmBeauty111, first page, featured, macbarbie07", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yo8Sh8Tx3is/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snrlh0_dXVs", "title": "Study Tips for Success 🤓| Physical Therapy School", "description": "Few basic study tips that you need to know for PT school.

Sometimes you may have to study alone or remotely and this can seem like a lonely experience but you're not on your own - our top tips are here to motivate you. Watch this video to find out six top tips to help you when you have to study alone. Then visit our website and test your understanding in our quiz: http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/english-you-need/unit-19/session-1 [Images: Getty Images] Transcript Rob Sometimes you may have to study alone or remotely and this can seem like a lonely experience. But you're not on your own - our top tips are here to motivate you. Firstly, you need to choose the right place to study – create a dedicated study space and the right environment for learning and remove any distractions. Now think about when you'll use this space – organise your time effectively and make a timetable. Choose the right time of day to study – but don't overdo it and know when to stop and take a break! Listen to what this student does… Student I was terrible at time management at first but I've learnt to get organised and write down every appointment I have and every task I have to do in the diary. This allows me to plan my week. I also stick a list of goals I have to achieve each week on the wall. When I complete them I cross them off. Rob Studying alone can be boring so you need make things fun – use a range of learning materials and techniques and especially interactive materials online. You can feel isolated when working alone so try to join a local study group where you can talk to other students. If that's not possible, join an online group. You can also make friends and keep in touch by email, chat rooms or video calls. Of course, ideally it's good to learn face-to-face with someone so maybe there's a friend you can meet to study with? Or perhaps you can join a local language school? Finally, when you need help you need to know where to go. Make sure the course you're studying has someone you can contact to ask questions and get clarification. Just remember, you're not completely on your own when you study alone!

These are as follows : 1) Study short but often means study regularly because it’s more productive. 2) Everybody is different. Find your own style of studying, some like to study in silence, some don’t like to study in silence. 3) For storing information properly in brain, we need proper sleep. 4) Focus - If you tend to procrastinate which means you tend to switch from something hard to something easy because of lack of interest or focus. Protect yourself from that. 5) Pomodoro Technique - Before start studying, set alarm 25 min. as the alarm rings take break of 5 min.These 5 min. are actually relaxing u0026 motivating you to keep going. 6) Hard stuff first, do the things that are difficult first because once you are done with hard subjects you’ll feel more relaxed. 7) Study at different places. By doing this you can create deeper memories of a subject. 8) Physical exercise u0026 regular meditation helps to create new neurons inside your brain. 9) In order to remember things for a longer time revise the portion you studied before. 10) Enjoy fun moments because it helps you to increase your learning potential. 11) After you studied, finish up with quick quiz u0026 recall everything in short summary.

They have the freedom to choose which classes to take, when to take the classes, and how to take them every semester. Sometimes depending on which college they go to, students might be lucky and are able to schedule their exams.  But, that’s not the case for graduate school (or at least for mine). It’s not as lenient and there’s a set curriculum that graduate students need to follow (with the exception of electives), so we didn’t have the opportunity to pick and choose which classes we wanted to take and when and how we wanted to take them.  During my first year in optometry school, I was bombarded with a bunch of hard classes and long labs. On top of that, I worked part-time at an optometrist’s clinic. Luckily, the study habits I picked up during my undergraduate days helped me score well in all my classes! To all my incoming first-year optometry students (or any student who needs help with studying), I wanted to share some of my tips on how studying EFFICIENTLY helped me ace all my classes.  --- Looking for something comfortable to wear during clinic? Check out the ones I’m wearing!

It can be a way to earn a degree without being limited by geography or class schedules. Many online students are working adults who choose online programs to earn new degrees and skills to advance in their careers. With online learning, you can study at your own pace. Yet if you want to succeed in your online education, it’s important to develop good study habits. Here are five online study tips to help you in this area. Study Tips For Online Students 1. Develop a schedule * Set aside a specific time every day. Schedule your study time. And stick to it! * A schedule provides limits. When tempted to do anything other than study tell yourself: “I’m at school right now.” 2. Create a workspace * Improve focus by separating your schoolwork from other responsibilities. * Stay organized by keeping your supplies in one spot. 3. Set goals and rewards * Keep track of your progress by setting daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term goals. * Reward yourself when you reach attainable goals. Rewards can be simple: a special snack or extra study breaks. 4. Visualize your motivation * Place a picture of what motivates you in your workspace to remind yourself of what you’re working toward. * Change or update your picture if your reasons for finishing school change or as you complete your short-term goals. 5. Practice makes perfect * It can be challenging to study at home- but it’s a skill that can be learned! Keep calm and study on! * Find a groove that works for you and your family with practice and patience.

THE VIDEOS Katherine has divided the QCE Biology 1u00262 course into ten easy-to-consume sections.

People new to the Salesforce ecosystem often wonder where they should start, and how they can make the most of their study time. Focus on Force Founder Martin Gessner continues his conversation with Salesforce Architect and Colorado Springs User Group Leader Roy Moore about how “learning by osmosis” is not as effective as most people think it is, how following a four-step study plan (Aim, Plan, Focus, and Practice) enables realistic goal-setting, and how one can go about having hands-on experience when you don’t actually have hands-on experience. Roy Moore has been Salesforcing since 2010 and has passed 7 exams on the first try, and 3 exams on the second try — making him an 11X certified Application Architect (heading for Platform Architect). He is a 6X Trailhead Ranger and is Co-Leader of the Colorado Springs Salesforce User Group. Martin and Roy discuss how one can start his/her Salesforce certification exam preparations by using Trailhead, joining instructor-led courses, having hands-on experience, as well as other resources.

If you take it step by step it’s really not as difficult as it may seem. Each Kanji character has meaning, so once you learn the Kanji it actually makes reading in general easier! ***DISCLAIMER*** I am NOT a certified teacher, nor am I a certified linguist.

I'm talking, of course, about back-to-school season. Just kidding, back-to-school doesn't have to be all that bad if you get your time management skills in tip-top shape and remember to do things you love in the midst of all of the studying that you're required to do. Hopefully in this video I can give you some ~big sis~ school advice. I loooove giving advice and so this is my longest video yet (oops), but as a 4.0 student (so far), I think I'm somewhat qualified to dispense that advice. If you don't want to watch the video, my answer to half of the questions was (sPoiLEr aLErt) WEEKLY PLANNING, so there you go. I apologize for the relatively low production quality of this video. I've been feeling kinda off for a few days so I didn't have it in me to put together a fancy video (maybe I should take my own advice on motivation, lol) and so I really wanted to just sit down and do a nice, long talking video.

MADRID, SPAIN - Welcome to Madrid and today I’m hanging out with my friend @Spain Revealed from Spain Revealed, and we’re going to take you on an ultimate Spanish food tour, specifically eating dishes that are local in Madrid. From churros to snails and tapas to cocido Madrileño, get ready for the ultimate Spanish food tour in Madrid! Here are all the places we went to eat in this tour: Chocolat (https://g.page/Chocolat-Madrid?share) - We started with churros at Chocolat, one of the best places you’ll find in the city. They make them fresh and serve them with creamy chocolate. The perfect way to start a day in Madrid. La Casa del Abuelo (https://goo.gl/maps/rKw5QNi8cRon3vvD7) - Next up, James and I started with a tapas crawl, first heading to La Casa del Abuelo for their amazing shrimp cooked with garlic and olive oil in a clay pan. They are delicious, especially with some house wine. Casa Toni (https://goo.gl/maps/upxpEfSaysggDkrc8) - Next up for Casa Toni, another legendary tapas bar in Madrid, known for organ meats like pig ears on the hot plate and sweet breads. Again, a delicious friendly place, and very Madrid culture. Restaurante Casa Amadeo los Caracoles (https://goo.gl/maps/d86FSKqBEZZKjs2j7) - One of my favorite places this entire Spanish food tour in Madrid was Restaurante Casa Amadeo los Caracoles, that’s a tapas bar that specializes in snails cooked with chili and all sorts of pig parts and sausages for flavor. Amadeo the owner is 93 years old and he’s so energetic with a heart of gold. He taught us how to eat some of his favorite dishes. Posada de la Villa (https://g.page/posada-de-la-villa?share) - Next up we continued to Posada de la Villa for roasted lamb. Again legendary, and so good! Malacatín (https://g.page/Malacatin?share) - Finally to complete this food tour, there’s no way we could miss cocido Madrileño, a Madrid specialty that includes soup made from a variety of meats, with chickpeas, meats, vegetables. It’s the ultimate heavy meal comfort food and something you have to eat when you’re in Madrid. Thank you for watching and hope you enjoyed this ultimate Spanish food tour in Madrid! Thank you again to @Spain Revealed - wouldn’t have been possible without him.

I’m from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer.  If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 🎬CREDITS: HOST » Sonny Side DP » Tony Sylvers CAMERA OPERATOR » Dylan Johnson VIDEO EDITOR » Hà Nhật Linh PRODUCER » Liz Peterson PRODUCTION COORDINATORS » Huỳnh Hà My u0026 Khoi Chung COLOR u0026 MASTER » Quí Nguyễn  Selected tracks via Audio Network For business inquiries: marketing@befrs.com", "tags": "best ever food review show, befrs team, sonny side, america, north america food, usa, the united state, texas food, where to eat in dallas, BestEverUSATour, State fair of texas, Sandwiches, texans are insane, KRISPY KREME FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH, Calvin, Minnesota, Mineapolis", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jaHd1Fm5zl0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf_dVQLM_vg", "title": "Americans Try Mexican Street Food for the First Time (Tlayuda, Tostilocos, Esquites)", "description": "Americans try some of the tastiest Mexican Street Food (other than tacos) for the first time!

If living in the Netherlands has shown us anything it's that Dutch food is anything but bland. DUTCH CHEESE can be unique to say the least but unique doesn't mean bad...smelly maybe but not bad. I never expected such a wide range of unique cheeses to this part of the country but I can tell you this, Dutch cheese is some of the best in the world. So you can say, this is kind of a mini Dutch cheese review on the smelly and not so smelly. During the Dutch food taste test there were some hits and misses but we had some fun doing it! Life in the Netherlands as a foreigner with new food to explore has been great...If it ain't Dutch it ain't much! So here's my little living in the Netherlands vlog, I hope you enjoy it!

Make sure to check out his latest vid, where you can watch us both eat spicy food and handle it really well. It wasn’t even that spicy. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - » THE EXOTIC FOODS 1. TALAD KAO MARKET: Mrs. Pan’s Bug Cart ADDRESS: Soi Lat Krabang 5, Lat Krabang, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10520 OPEN: 2PM - 10PM  🦗The night before Mrs. Pan cooks the bugs she will later sell in the market, her son goes to Khlong Toei, Bangkok’s largest wet market, to purchase a variety of insects. She begins cooking each morning in order to make it to the market and set up her cart by 2pm. To cook the bugs, Mrs. Pan first adds oil and chopped pandan leaves to a frying pan. The pandan leaves add a nice fragrance to the bugs while cutting the bitter taste. She adds her first round of bugs and allows them to fry for roughly 30 minutes. She allows the crickets to cook for only 15 minutes. To enhance the flavors, she does not clean the pan between bugs. Then she’s off to the market, to fill hungry bellies with bugs!  💸PRICE: 1.50 USD/50 THB for Mixed Bowl of Bugs 1.20 USD/40 THB for Giant Water Bug 2. TOY KUAY TEOW: Boat Noodles (Blood Noodle Soup) ADDRESS: 15 Ratchawithi Rd, Khwaeng Thung Phaya Thai, Khet Ratchathewi, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon OPEN: 8AM - 6PM 🍜Toy Kuay Teow has been serving up boat noodles for 50 years and is on its third generation. To make one of Bangkok’s most beloved noodle soups, combine chilli dressing, pork, meatballs, vermicelli noodles, pork blood, pork soup, scallions and herbs, bok choy, fried pork skin and fried flat noodles (optional). Beef boat noodles include beef blood, rather than pork blood. 💸PRICE: .46 USD/15 THB for a small bowl .91 USD/30 THB for a normal bowl 3. J'KHAI SEAFOOD: Horseshoe Crab Eggs ADDRESS: 1300/3-4 Prachachuen Road, Bangsue Bangkok OPEN: 3PM - 12AM  J’Khai Seafood started when the owner began selling food from a small cart 34 years ago. It is now a multi-story restaurant in Bangkok, and their signature “Thai curry steamed horseshoe crab eggs” recently won Wongnai Users’ Choice for best dish.  🦀To make this tasty meal, they first steam the horseshoe crab, cutting open the lower part of the crab to remove all of the eggs. Separately, create the seasoning, mixing Thai red curry paste, sugar, MSG, oyster sauce and carnation milk. Add the seasoning to an oiled, heated pan before adding chicken egg and finger root. Allow to stir-fry for a bit, then scoop everything back into the horseshoe crab shell. Take the horseshoe crab and grill it over hot charcoal until bubbling. Top it off with coconut milk, sliced lime leaves and carrots before diving in.  💸PRICE: 15 USD/500 THB per Horseshoe Crab (may vary) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 💬COME SAY HI: INSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/InstaSonnySide FACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook 💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION: Patreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be.  I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country.

So it’s always important to get a daily dose of vitamins and minerals. This easy to make popsicle is an excellent source to get the vitamins and nutrients your body needs but in a great tasting and enjoyable way. Good boosting your immunity for both parents and children.  Recipe: 2 Oranges Ginger 1/2 Lemon 4 Carrots 1 piece Turmeric 1 tsp Honey What makes this drink beneficial? Vitamin A, found in orange, aids in the production of new white blood cells, the immune cells that travel through your circulation in search of and eliminate viruses that might be detrimental to you.  Ginger's anti-inflammatory qualities aid in immune system stimulation.  Lemon, on the other hand, is packed with Vitamin C which assists in antimicrobial action by improving the operation of what is known as natural killer cells, which help to remove infections Anthocyanin, a compound found in purple carrots can help reduce inflammation.  Carrots and honey contain lots of vitamin A, which aids in the production of white blood cells known as T-cells that shields the body against cancer-causing cells.  One of the compounds that may be found in turmeric is called curcumin, and it is known to have anti-inflammatory qualities that can help enhance immunity.  Remember, a healthy immune system also requires an active lifestyle. It’s never too late to start!

The western coast of Croatia is home to the beautiful region of Istria, which is often overlooked by Croatian tourists. Check out Goran's Channel: https://youtu.be/kHykb6QXtDg After leaving the capital of Zagreb, we set out on our Croatian road trip, and our first stop was Pula. Luckily, we had a wonderful local Croatian friend Renata, to take us around the Pula Arena and give a quick tour of Pula. We eat a traditional Croatian lunch, and enjoy some delicious gelato before having to leave Pula for Rovinj. Renata's Watercolor workshops in Pula: https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1710182 From Pula, we checked into our accommodation in Rovinjsko Selo, nearby the popular Rovinj, Croatia, and then drove into Rovinj for sunset. Rovinj is such a beautiful little city. It is also more popular for travelers than Pula. The next morning, we leave Rovinj for Motovun to experience an Istria Food Tour around the amazing Istrian countryside with Eat Istria ( https://eatistria.com). Our day started at the foothills of Motovun; a fairytale-like village in Istria. We started at Mira Tartufi farm, before heading out into the Istrian forest to hunt for truffles! Miro Tartufi (Truffle Farm) - http://miro-tartufi.com/en/ After the first leg of our Istria food tour, we leave Motovun and drive through the Istrian countryside to try some delicious and overwhelming, haha, goat cheeses! Kumparicka Goat Farm - https://www.kumparicka.com/en/home Finally, we finish our Istria food tour with lunch at a traditional Croatian Konoba - or local farm-to-table tavern. We try fresh pasta and meats that are 100% from this farm. Amazing! Konoba \"DOMA\" - https://konoba-doma.business.site We finish the day back in Rovinj for sunset again. I join my local friend Ella for more delicious gelato at her favorite spot right in the heart of Rovinj old town and then we hangout along the coast. Gelateria I Nonni (Rovinj) - https://www.facebook.com/inonnicroatia/ We cap off an amazing experience her in Istria with a swim in the Adriatic Sea. This region of Croatia is absolutely incredible.

Pulao and biryanis in Hyderabad. Pulao restaurants in Hyderabad. Raju Gari Pulao, Rayala Vari Kodi Pulao. This hugely popular establishment in Hyderabad is famous for its unique takes on traditional recipes. Their specialties are their biryanis or rather, their pulaos, of which they make 18 varieties! And each of them has its own unique flavour and character. Food Lovers' Editor, Kripal Amanna joins Ravitej Ravuri of StreetByte on an epic pulao tasting session. He tastes a couple of unconventional starters namely, the Bamboo Chicken, an appetiser of chicken cooked in a bamboo stalk in a tandoor, and the Bangla Kodi. From their wide menu of pulaos, he tries the unique Raju Gari Pulao, a vegetarian Guthivankaya Pulao with eggplant, as well as the Rayala Vary Kodi Pulao with gongura leaves. He rounds off the meal with an indulgent rose milk and a sweet pudding called Junnu made from colostrum.

This glorious delicacy is a staple for the locals and the go-to dish for the tourists. Hyderabadi Biryani is characteristically distinct from its popular counterparts because of its distinct aroma, taste, texture and the mode of preparation. With the essence of Turkish, Mughlai and Arabic influences in it, the Hyderabadi Biryani has been an integral part of the Hyderabad’s culinary tradition since a long time. In this culinary exploration, we have set out to savour the dazzling aura of this majestic dish at some of the most famed destinations across the city. We are happy to be accompanied by our gracious host Sankalp Vishnu who is an acclaimed food critic and food expert. We tried Hyderabadi biryani at two eminent places-The Lucky restaurant and the Bawarchi restaurant. Our intention was to understand the nuances or fine tuning of the variations in the Hyderabadi biryani as adopted by these joints.  Our first stop was the Lucky restaurant that serves one of the best versions of the Kachi Gost Ki Biryani. We got the opportunity to witness the making of a batch of Hyderabadi Biryani at their wonderful, aromatic kitchen. The seemingly easy procedure entails an astute understanding of the dynamics of its cooking, perseverance and dexterity. The genial owner for Lucky restaurant walked us through the process sharing all the details of their prized preparation. We then tried the Nalli Biryani along with some other delectable meaty wonders. The feast ended with the lusciously amazing Khubani ka Meetha a dessert that’s exclusive to the city. The next day we went to the acclaimed Bawarchi restaurant to try their version of the Hyderabadi Biryani. In recent years it has emerged as favourite destination for the same. The beautifully done Chicken Biryani was worth all the reputation. It ticked all the boxes of parameters that make the magic of a biryani work. A distinct feature of the biryani here was the pleasantly notable presence of the shah jeera flavour in it. Here we also tried the Hyderabad famous Double Ka Meetha and the Kaddu ka kheer. The latter one was the best.  While winding up this Hyderabadi biryani trail we couldn’t but wonder at the flamboyant stature of this apparently royal dish that rules the heart of the masses in and beyond this city.  We are truly grateful to Sankalp Vishnu for his cooperation.
